            <h3>memories</h3>
                <p>ugh, i have such a big fondness for toontown, it's such a big part of my childhood. even when i couldn't afford
            membership to go beyond toontown central, i was always consuming toontown content on youtube, lurking in nutty summit
            to go to people's estates for games, and just so much more.</p><br>
            <p>i currently play <b>toontown rewritten</b> and <b>toontown corporate clash</b>! my main toon on ttr is a black cat
            named cassiopeia, who is around 100 laff. she's the toon below the title, and if you click her, she'll play a familiar
            gag's sound effect!	i'm very shy in toontown so it's been a little difficult to progress through cog bosses. my second
            toon is a brown deer named chopper, aptly named after . . . chopper. chopper from one piece. i haven't been able to get
            back into ttcc as much lately, but i was playing a black cat named caveira before i took a break from playing, named
            after caveira from r6 siege.</p><br>
            <p>my most prevalent toon i recall from my time in toontown online was a pinky-purple rabbit called moonglow. i remember
            she had the poetic nametag style. maybe i'll remake her in one of the current servers if i get the motivation to. 
            aesthetically, my favorite playground is donald's dreamland. i just love the soft, lullaby sound of all the music
            and the relaxing purple tones for the streets and playground. i also have a massive fondness for toontown central
            as it's the beginning of the game and thus home to a lot of my memories, granted that that's where i had to stay
            when i was without membership.</p><br>
            <p>gosh, speaking of, i remember the absolute joy that came of me the rare occasions i got a one-month membership to the game,
            on those little gift card-like packages. the times i didn't have membership, i remember jumping between accounts a lot, as you
            could only make two, and later one toon. i vaguely remember being able to use that pink square before that free option was taken
            away! oh my gosh, and you couldn't make a monkey, a bear, or a horse as a free player. i liked the cats and the rabbits though.
            i also remember watching a ton of coach z as a kid, and being mildly confused when the homestar runner character came up when
            i searched on google. another youtuber i loved was the random toon show. rest in peace, michael.</p><br>

        <p>my favorite trolley game was match minnie!</p><br>
        <img class="adam" src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/toontown/images/d/d8/Ring_Game.png"><br><br>
        <p>ring game is also super fun, and is actually the thing i visualize when i imagine my childhood time spent playing.</p><br>
