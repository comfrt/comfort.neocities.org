            <center><p>welcome to my <i>academia</i> hub! this is a space for me to not only share my
            own works and creations, but also those that i have found to particularly resonate
            with me and my experiences, both as a consumer and as an individual in the world.
            generally, i would suggest traversing the contents this page links to with caution,
            as academia often delves into more uncomfortable subject matter (especially where
            my interests in particular lie) and i don't want anyone getting hurt or upset!</p></center>
            <h3>my works</h3>
            <center><a href="https://comfort.neocities.org/interests/bwoessay.html" style="max-width:550px;">men, women, and paint cans: a reading of better watch out through the lens of her body, himself</a></span>
             <p>please note that my better watch out essay contains multiple discussions of <b>rape and sexual assault,
            violence and gore, sexuality, violence specifically against women, and similar themes along those lines</b>. i would suggest that
            only people above the age of eighteen read this due to the heavy graphic content discussed throughout the essay. but, still, this
            is a complete labour of love for this film. i adore better watch out very greatly, and discussing it
            at length like this is the greatest justice i can do it. also, if you would prefer to read it with none of my site's aesthetic
            stylization over on google drive, that link is right <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/14v2QMT4TmbEvAwmA4vuyWMBq-KX0zF1FV7cj1ehkPCs/edit?usp=sharing">here!</a>
