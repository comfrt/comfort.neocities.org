                        about better watch out, and for that, it will be getting its own pages in time (shrines, motifs, and reviews, oh my!).
                        but as far what i can say right now...  i think everything about this film is absolutely phenomenal.
                        the acting is out of this world, especially given the young ages of the main cast. the score, the
                        cinematography, the writing: everything comes together to cement my adoration.

                    <p class="movie-opinion-text">surprisingly, it took me until 2024 to watch this film for the first time. i consider myself rather
                        tentative with my consumption of new media, but <em>god</em> was it worth the watch! rosamund pike's performance as amy sets an incredibly high bar. this film is entrancing.
                        as of writing this (18-07-24), i had rewatched it yesterday, only to put it back on as soon as it finished because i was that absorbed
                        in the world and characters it creates.

                        stuck with me since i first watched teeth in high school. however, it can get uncomfortable
                        when sexual violence becomes gratuitous and drawn out. teeth is even listed as a comedy horror online,
                        which i think is absolutely absurd given the relatively depressing tone of the film.

                        train to busan was one of those, and it was absolutely worth the watch! my favorite character is
                        sang-hwa... my social8 king. train to busan was amazing, and completely deserving of its hype.

                        quickly enthralled into the story. it's phenomenal, and there are so many layers of symbolism
                        and theming to think about when discussing the film. my favorite character is ki-jeong.

                    adaptation of its source, but if you can put all that aside, it's a very fun romp. light and mia are fascinating
                    characters, and i'm especially fond of how mia, as a female character, gets to take the role

                    <p class="movie-opinion-text">totally killer is very fun. the third act is gorgeous,
                        with some of my favorite lighting i've seen in films. does it reinvent the wheel? no,
                        but i don't think it has to. i love when media gets referential (look how much i revere
                        better watch out), and i think totally killer pulls off the tone without it getting schlocky
                        or losing its punch. <em>i think that moment was connected to you!</em>

                    and especially resonant with the #weirdgirls. i think this film would've benefitted greatly from
                    a r-rating to fully convey the depth and darkness of lisa's character. the relationship between
                    taffy and lisa is so important to me, and i'm glad a peppy cheerleader gets to be genuinely nice.

                    <p class="movie-opinion-text">the chipmunk adventure is very much a product of its time. extremely negative and racist stereotypes. weird sexualization of the chipettes.
                    literally a song called getting lucky where they dance with snakes. it's not great. but, keeping its glaring flaws in
                    mind, i nevertheless harbor a nostalgic fondness for it, especially the songs <em>the boys and girls
                    of rock and roll</em> and <em>diamond dolls</em>. if you haven't seen it, i don't think you're missing much, though.

                        little rascals film was not. but i love this movie so much. it's so close to my heart. it's so sweet, and
                        happy, and nostalgic. it makes my heart glow. the little rascals (1994), you're perfect.

                        are at their best in d2, and uma is an absolute darling and works amazingly in her role, especially as the
                        antithesis to what mal stands for, in all of her loathsome violet selfishness. every moment i watch in the
                        original trilogy solidifies my hatred for mal and my absolute veneration of every other character.

                    audrey makes a welcomed return. words alone cannot express how much i hate mal. she is so
                    boring to me as a character and lacks anything making her compelling. jay and carlos were
                    robbed of screentime and purpose thanks to her big purple head.

                    <p class="movie-opinion-text">absolutely adore bottoms. it was so funny, and all of the female characters feel authentic while
                    not entirely straying from the immaculate comedy. the handling of jeff's character as a commentary on football players made
                    into pariahs in high-school centered media was so good. i literally cannot say enough that is positive about bottoms. please
                    watch it. it is worth your time.</p>

                    <p class="movie-opinion-text">i actually had a phenomenal theatre experience for terrifier 3. i greatly enjoyed terrifier 2, especially when
                        compared to its predecessor, so i had pretty high hopes going into t3. and i don't think i was left disappointed! sienna shaw is a phenomenal final girl,
                        and i have the deepest veneration for her character. even as i was watching, i had a ton of essay ideas floating around
                        in my head, so i'm excited to expand on them. i love you sienna shaw!
