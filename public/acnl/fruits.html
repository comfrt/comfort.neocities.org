            </ul><br>
            <center><p>there are a few ways you can get the fruits not native to your town.</p></center>
            <br><h4>ask isabelle for advice</h4>
        <center><p>before you have 100% town rating, ask isabelle for advice on increasing your rating.
            one of the quests involves you going to the beach. if you bring her back a seashell, she will reward
            you with a basket of non-native fruit.
        </p></center><br>
        <h4>make friends with your villagers</h4>
        <center><p>if your friendship gets high enough with your villagers, they may give you fruit.
            you can also send villagers letters asking to swap fruits and attach a stack of fruit.
        </p></center><br>
        <h4>the harvest festival</h4>
        <center><p>all of the fruits except cherries are used in recipes for harvest day.
            villagers will trade you the various ingredients needed (<em>fruits</em>, in this case)
            in exchange for a specific fish.
        </p></center><br>
        <h4>letters from mom</h4>
        <center><p>your mother can send you fruit all throughout the year. having 4 characters raises
            the likelihood as they all receive letters and can get different fruit.
        </p></center><br>
        <h4>t&t emporium</h4>
        <center><p>you can purchase bamboo and persimmons at the fully upgraded nookling store.</p></center><br>
        <h4>island tours</h4>
        <center><p>obviously pertaining to the island fruits, but you can collect the fruits both from the beach outside and on tours.</p><center></center></section>
