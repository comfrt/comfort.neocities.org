            <h2>ABOUT</h2>
            <center><p>bj&#246;rk was born on the 21st of november 1965 in reykjavík, iceland.
            she was raised by her mother, hildur rúna hauksd&#243;ttir, after a divorce
            from her father, gu&#240;mundur gunnarsson, in 1968 &#8212; the marriage falling apart
            due to expectations on hildur to be a housewife, something she was personally
            against. her mother was an activist, after all, with a rebellious spirit to
            accompany. as such, after the separation, bj&#246;rk and her mother moved to a hippie
            commune, with a stream of musicians and artists commonly gathering in the family
            home to play music, drink, and share their stories.</p>
            <br>
            <p>bj&#246;rk's musical inclinations started early, as she began attending
            barnamúsíksk&#243;li reykjavíkur (now known as <i>t&#243;nmenntask&#243;li reykjavík</i>)
            at the age of five, graduating in 1980 at the age of fourteen. it is there that she learned to play both the piano
            and the flute. after a school recital wherein bj&#246;rk sang tina charles's
            <u style="text-decoration-style:solid;">i love to love</u>, a recording of it was sent by one of her teachers
            to rúv radio station. the record was broadcast nationally, and she was
            approached by a representative of the fálkinn record label with an offer
            of a recording contract.</p>
            <br>
            <p>she was given the chance to record an album, and, after spending august 
            and september of 1977 recording it, <u onMouseover="ddrivetip('self-titled and viewed as juvenilia work')"; onMouseout="hideddrivetip()">bj&#246;rk</u> was released
            in december 1977. the songs on the album were a mixture of covers translated
            into icelandic and songs written specifically for the album. the album was
            recorded at hlj&#243;&#240;riti studios in reykjavík, and the cover was designed by
            her mother. with the money she earned from the album, bj&#246;rk bought herself
            a piano, and began to compose more of her own songs. though the album charted
            in iceland, the young artist wasn't quite prepared for celebrity status, as 
            the idolization from friends at school eager for her attention caused her to
            feel dejected. socially, she then on found herself surrounded by musicians
            three times her age, many of whom encouraged her to put out a second album.</p>
            <br>
            <p>the late seventies and early eighties marked when punk music hit iceland. in accordance,
            at the age of thirteen, bj&#246;rk performed as the drummer in a militant hardcore-feminist
            riot-grrrl-combo called spit and snot, which wrote songs about how much they hated men.
            during this time, she sported shaved eyebrows and orange hair. though they quickly
            disbanded due to so-called attitude problems, bj&#246;rk said the group believed that 
            “boys are crap [and] they're only good for shagging”. she also described the band
            as “girls having fun, and f**k that sitting-around-and-being-cute”. another band bj&#246;rk formed
            was exodus, remembered as a naïve blend of new wave and pop. two years later, she
            emerged as the lead singer in <u onMouseover="ddrivetip('translated as cork the bitch’s ass')"; onMouseout="hideddrivetip()">tappi tikarrass</u>,
            a punk-pop band. it was in that same year that bj&#246;rk got her tattoo, a <u onMouseover="ddrivetip('viking compass')"; onMouseout="hideddrivetip()">vegvísir</u>.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>bj&#246;rk was sixteen when she fell in love with Þ&#243;r eldon, stating how it was love at
            first sight and how she moved into his house the same evening that they met. she was
            eventually enlisted as a lead vocalist in icelandic supergroup <u onMouseover="ddrivetip('meaning witchcraft/sorcery in medieval icelandic')"; onMouseout="hideddrivetip()">kukl</u>.
            the band's ethos questioned iceland's appropriated elements of the country's pagan past to
            shore up its own belief systems. kukl managed to stir up its own controvery besides that,
            however, such as the april 1986 television broadcast of the band performing. bj&#246;rk,
            dressed in only a bra and skirt, was seven months pregnant, with eyebrows shaven yet
            armpits unshaven. an elderly woman that was watching allegedly suffered a heart attack,
            blaming the ugliness of bj&#246;rk's pregnant belly, and even went on to sue her. bj&#246;rk
            gave birth two months later, on june 8th 1986, to her son sindri eldon Þ&#243;rsson. she and
            Þ&#243;r eldon were also wed in 1986, though she described it to be a marriage more of 
            convenience than anything else &#8212; it took 10 minutes, and then they could get money from 
            the state for Þ&#243;r to get contact lenses.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            when kukl went their separate ways, one of her former bandmates, einar &#246;rn, wanted to
            start a new band. he gathered bj&#246;rk, Þ&#243;r eldon, and some former kukl members, and
            the sugarcubes were born. much more deliberately oriented towards pop music than bj&#246;rk's 
            previous stints with punk, jazz, new wave, and other genres, the group achieved great
            success. the band signed to one little indian (now one little independent records) in the
            united kingdom, and elektra records in the united states, and released their debut album,
            life's too good, in april 1988. their second record, here today, tomorrow next week!, was released
            in september 1989, and many of the reviews viewed it as a weaker piece of work than the preceding
            album. stick around for joy, the sugarcubes's third and final album, was released in february
            1992. it received noticably better reviews than their second album, and it even spawned their
            first big hit, with <u style="text-decoration-style:solid;">hit</u>. the sugarcubes disbanded 
            in december 1992. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>so, what was next for bj&#246;rk except embarking on an epic solo career? she moved to london to
        pursue said solo career, and released debut in june 1993. it was named debut to signify the start
        of something new. the album included collaborations with nellee hooper, as well as david arnold
        for play dead, which was included on re-issues of debut. debut was heavily themed around love,
        from "flesh-and-blood" passion for another person, to the love of life itself. the album had 
        five singles, being: human behavior, venus as a boy, play dead, big time sensuality, and
        violently happy. though all charted in the united kingdom, only human behavior, big time sensuality,
        and violently happy charted in the united states. debut is widely regarded as one of the best
        albums of 1993, as well as the 90s in general. bj&#246;rk won best newcomer and best international
        female at the 1994 brit awards thanks to this release. in sonic symbolism, debut is described
        as the following: shy, beginner, humility, virgin, beige, silver, mohair, the messenger.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>work started on her next studio album, post, in late 1994. contrary to debut's gentler
        house music direction, post had much more of an edge, touching on musical styles like
        industrial and experimental. bj&#246;rk furthermore recognized post as more aggressive than debut,
        and identified independence, strength, and instinct as its lyrical themes. the title post
        refers to two things: one being how all songs were written post her move to england, and 
        two being a reference to how she wished to communicate with her friends and family back in iceland,
        adding the meaning of mail. this is further showcased in the album cover, wherein she is depicted
        wearing a jacket inspired by royal mail envelopes. many controversies surrounded post, its release,
        and the span of time thereafter. some of the controveries include the removal of the army of
        me music video from mtv's playlist &#8212; which depicted her bombing an art museum, sadly overlapping with 
        the oklahoma city bombing &#8212; as well as being sued by former collaborator simon fisher. additionally,
        the consistent media attention as well as excess of tour dates began to affect bj&#246;rk. one 
        such example is the infamous welcome to bangkok incident. while on tour in february 1996, bj&#246;rk
        arrived at bangkok international airport with sindri. reporter julie kaufman, who had allegedly 
        been bothering the two for days prior, approached them and said “welcome to bangkok!” this provoked
        bj&#246;rk to charge at kaufman and wrestle her to the ground. kaufman declined to press chargers.
        much of bj&#246;rk's persona during the post era left her viewed by the media as having a sort of
        pixie-like character. in sonic symbolism, post is described as the following: urban, greedy,
        promiscuity, euphoric, absorb, orange, pink, urban.
        </p>

        <details>
        <summary>trigger warning for stalking, suicide, and racism contained inside. incredibly heavy subject matter, please proceed with caution.</summary>
        <p>ricardo l&#243;pez was a man with poor self-esteem who was very socially reclusive: he had 
        few male friends and no female friends nor girlfriends. he had aspirations to become
        a famous artist, even dropping out of high school in hopes of achieving said aspirations,
        but never genuinely pursued a career due to his feelings of inadequacy. instead, he worked
        for his brother's pest control company. incredibly reclusive by this point, l&#243;pez began to
        retreat into a world of celebrity worship as a form of escape.</p>
        <br>
        <p>his obsession with bj&#246;rk began in 1993. he started to collect information about her life, followed
        her career heavily, and wrote her many fan letters. l&#243;pez at first cited bj&#246;rk as his muse,
        and said that she gave him a euphoric feeling. he kept a diary, wherein he wrote of his longing
        to be accepted by bj&#246;rk, and to be a person that had an impact on her life; he even went so far 
        as to fantasize about creating a time machine so he could go back to the 1970s and befriend her
        as a child.</p>
        <br>
        <p>even on the first page of his diary, l&#243;pez alluded to suicide, writing “a few years from now . . . if i'm still here”.
        fascinatingly, his fixation on bj&#246;rk was nonsexual and even nonromantic, and he claimed that he could never
        have sex with bj&#246;rk because he loved her, alluding to the madonna-prostitute complex. in his diary's 803 pages,
        l&#243;pez made 14 direct and indirect references to homocide, and 34 references to suicide. other celebrities
        were described 52 times, and he described his deep feelings of self-loathing 168 times. bj&#246;rk remained
        the most popular subject, however, with a staggering 408 references.</p>
        <br>
        <p>l&#243;pez's positive obsession with bj&#246;rk carried on for almost two years. however, it suddenly
        switched to extreme hostility upon the revelation of bj&#246;rk's romantic involvement with goldie.
        he viewed the interracial relationship as something unacceptable, and the relationship 
        inflamed his already dangerous views on race. day after day after day, he detailed his anger
        and all of his feelings of betrayal, and slowly developed a plan to punish her. it was a twelve
        month span between the origins of his anger towards bj&#246;rk and when he decided he wanted to try
        to kill her, and less than three months after that, he formulated his plan, and carried it out.</p>
        <br>
        <p>when his obsession shifted from fan worship to homocidal ideation, l&#243;pez stopped writing in 
        his diary and began videotaping himself. his initial plan was to a construct a hollowed-out book,
        where, upon the book opening, needles with aids-tainted blood he intended to obtain from a prostitute
        would pop out and inject her. his goal with this was not to kill her, but instead to give her a disease,
        so he would be part of her life forever. this plan was subsequently abandoned due to the logistics,
        l&#243;pez thankfully lacking the engineering ability to construct it. instead, he assembled a bomb,
        also containing sulfuric acid, and placed it into a hollowed-out book. his objective with this
        plan was for the bomb to detonate and for the acid to spray into her face upon the opening of the book,
        hoping that if it didn't kill her, bj&#246;rk would be permanently disfigured by the attack, and thus 
        he would be part of her life forever.</p>
        <br>
        <p>on september 12 1996, l&#243;pez began filming his final video diary, aptly titled “last day &#8212; ricardo l&#243;pez”.
        the tape firstly depicts him preparing to go to the post office and drop off the bomb, stating
        how he was very nervous, but that he would rather kill himself than be arrested should he arouse
        suspicion. the video diary further depicted l&#243;pez stripping naked, shaving off his hair and
        eyebrows, and painting himself with grease paint. seemingly in the style of colonel kurtz from
        apocalypse now, his nipples were painted red, his mouth was painted black, and his head was 
        painted red and green. police speculated that this was to make him less recognizable so it
        would be easier for him to take his own life.</p> 
       <br>
       <p>in the final moments of the video, i remember you plays as l&#243;pez grows increasingly anxious,
        a stark deviation from his otherwise calm demeanor in the rest of the tape. he begins to prattle
        about his final words, and says, “i just want to say, that... uh... my last words. what are my last words?
        well, f*ck the world, that's my last words. and, uh, f*ck bj&#246;rk. her and her [<i>n-word</i>]
        loving self.” as the song draws to a close, l&#243;pez exclaims what is speculated to be either
        “victory” or “this is for you”, and a .38 calibre revolver in his mouth to end his life.</p> 
        <br>
        <p>behind l&#243;pez in the video was a sheet of bristol board, reading “the best of me” in black marker. on the wall behind him, he had
        written, “the 8 mm videos documentation of a crime, terrorist matter, and for the fbi”.
        furthermore, “[<i>n-word</i>] lover” was written on his fridge, accompanying his vehement
        racism throughout the diaries.</p>
        <br>
        <p>four days after his death, on september 16 1996, a foul odor and blood were reported to be 
        coming from his apartment. the hollywood police department entered and discovered his corpse.
        the building was subsequently evacuated, while a bomb squad searched for explosives, finding
        none. after the police viewed his final tape, they contacted scotland yard to alert them about
        the bomb en route to bj&#246;rk's london residence. it hadn't been delivered yet, and the metropolitan
        police intercepted and safely detonated it.</p>
        <br>
        <p>two days after that, on september 18 1996, bj&#246;rk made a press statement, saying that she was
        very distressed by the incident. she sent a card and flowers to l&#243;pez's family, and left
        with sindri for spain. she also hired security for sindri, who was escorted to school by a
        minder.</p>
        <br>
        <p>the song so broken, available on the japanese edition of homogenic, is inspired by the
        events involving l&#243;pez.</p>

        <br>
        <p>working on new songs provided some much-needed therapy after all the events that had
        transpired, including both all of the controversies surrounding post's release as well 
        as the trauma from l&#243;pez. from the very start of homogenic's production, there was a conceptual focus on the geography
        of iceland. bj&#246;rk knew very early on that homogenic would be a simple record compared to that of her
        previous two works, and adopted <i>homogeneous</i> as its working title, which was eventually changed
        to homogenic. for the creation of homogenic, bj&#246;rk also had a very close working relationship 
        with post's engineer markus dravs. she allowed him an incredible amount of creative license, but
        refused to change on her basic concepts for the album. there were two primary elements: beats and strings.
        after the l&#243;pez incident, and the circus of media that begun to camp out on her lawn, quickly bj&#246;rk
        came to realize that she couldn't keep writing in london. her debut and post tour drummer trevor morais
        owned a studio in spain, which he offered to her for temporary respite. she only planned to stay
        in spain long enough to record the guitar portions of so broken, but was quickly enamored with her
        surroundings. after only a few days there, she decided to record all of homogenic in spain, barring
        her continued tradition of visiting reykjavík for christmas. in visting her native iceland that year,
        bj&#246;rk came to realize that she was returning to her roots with homogenic, compared to the comparatively
        more extroverted lifetyles and albums that debut and post encompassed. she returned to spain in january,
        homogenic released on september 20 1997, with a majority of the songs portraying lyrics about love
        and failed relationships. in sonic symbolism, homogenic is described as the following: warrior, active,
        volcanic beats, confrontational, icelandic octet, beats, cosmopolitan/icelandic contrast, green,
        patriotic.

        <p>
        in 1999, bj&#246;rk was asked to write and produce the musical score for lars von trier's dancer in the dark.
        he eventually asked her to consider playing the lead role &#8212; claiming the only true way to capture
        the character of selma was to have the composer play her. bj&#246;rk eventually accepted. there were multiple critical guidelines that she insisted upon to von trier, such as her
        need to have complete control over all of the film's musical elements. however, there is contention as
        to if such an agreement was ever on paper or merely a verbal one. while still living in reykjavík, bj&#246;rk
        attended tap dancing lessons three times a week, and began the songwriting process. working in this
        manner allowed her to get a grasp on selma's character even six months before they began filming. with 
        assistance of mark bell, guy sigsworth, valgeir sigurdsson, and sjon sigurdsson, selmasongs began to take
        shape. alongside the seven songs that composed the album, everyone's hard work also yielded a new track:
        amphibian. this new track foreshadowed the next direction for bj&#246;rk's music &#8212; a contrast of celebrated 
        fragility compared to that of homogenic's brazen strength. however, despite the incredible work put out,
        the relationship between von trier and bj&#246;rk was very fraught. bj&#246;rk once stated online, "[lars von trier]
        needs a female to provide his work soul. and he envies them and hates them for it. so he has to destroy 
        them during the filming. and hide the evidence." she furthermore accused von trier of sexual harassment
        (though omitted his name, referring to him only as 'a danish director') on facebook during the height of
        the #metoo movement. the shoot was overall so tiring, both physically and emotionally, that bj&#246;rk vowed
        to never act again.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        in the wake of all the tension accumulated whilst working on dancer in the dark was the tireless effort
        funneled into bj&#246;rk's fourth solo album, with a working title of <i>domestika</i>. in addition to the
        release of tension was also the release of an intense amount of love forged with matthew barney. having
        grown bored of fantastical big beats, bj&#246;rk instead found herself gravitating towards making a record for
        a more domestic sort of mood. this also marks the usage of her laptop as a compositional tool, fine-tuning
        molecular clicks from tinny speakers. there was also a focus on micro-beats and whispering vocals due to the
        ever-increasing rise of technology, as an artistic vision of how those noises would translate coming from
        poorer, cheaper speakers. she only used acoustic instruments that maintained a good sound even after being
        downloaded: the harp, the music box, celesta, and clavichord. the changing shape of the album also included
        a new name, shifting from <i>domestika</i> to vespertine. during vespertine's production, bj&#246;rk opted to
        move from iceland again, this time into barney's manhattan apartment. she left behind sindri, who opted
        to stay back with his father. after the album's tour, bj&#246;rk fulfilled a very select few of promotional
        engagements before returning to barney in manhattan. a month later, she was pregnant with her second child,
        fathered by barney. isadora was born on october 3 2002, while bj&#246;rk and barney were vacationing in paris.
        soon after the birth, the couple returned to manhattan to continue building their life together. in sonic symbolism,
        vespertine is described as the following: winter world, paradise, frozen, celestial, whispered vocals,
        microbeats, loyal, swans, harps, music boxes, laptops, orchestra, glockenspiels, salvation, choir.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>work on her fifth studio album, known as <i>the lake album</i> during early production, was majorly
        inspired by bj&#246;rk's yearning to step away from both the worlds of instruments and the worlds of electronics,
        claiming to have overdosed on them. furthermore, she wanted to see what could be accomplished with the
        entire emotional range of the human voice. one voice, a chorus, trained voices: not only melodies so much
        as every noise that a human being's throat could make. august 2004 marked the release of medúlla. it included
        the vocal skills of tanya tagaq, rahzel, dokaka, mike patton, robert wyatt, and several choirs. many aspects of
        medúlla were arranged so that bj&#246;rk could spend as much time with isadora as possible: no tours or bit concerts.
        she was also inspired by paganism, and the overall idea of returning to a world that is entirely human. a world
        without tools, without religion, without nationality. even further, bj&#246;rk also considered medúlla to be
        her most political album at the time of its construction. it countered the racism and patriotism in the wake
        of the september 11 terrorist attacks, and bj&#246;rk viewed the album as anti-patriotic in the sense that it was 
        against any sort of country, calling more for the unity of the human race. the same month that the album released,
        bj&#246;rk performed oceania at the opening ceremony of the 2004 summer olympics in athens. in sonic symbolism,
        medúlla is described as the following: primordial, motherhood, black braided hair, breastfeeding, passive, 
        pre-civilisation, goth, folk, archeology, boens, family around campfire.

        <p>
        in 2005, bj&#246;rk collaborated with barney on the film drawing restraint 9, which was a dialogueless
        exploration of japanese culture. both her and barney appear in the film, as western guests on a factory
        whaling vessel that ultimately transform into whales. she also created the film's soundtrack, titled
        <i>the music from matthew barney's drawing restraint 9</i>, or drawing restraint 9 for short,
        with credits as arranger, producer, programmer, keyboards, harp, and beat programming. drawing restraint 9
        is not typically included when fans speak of her body of work, perhaps owing to her vocals only appearing
        on three tracks: bath, storm, and cetacea. also in 2005, bj&#246;rk released <i>army of me: remixes and covers</i>,
        which featured a whopping seventeen remixes of army of me. it was organized in response to the 2004 indian
        ocean earthquake and tsunami, and bj&#246;rk put out a call on her website, reaching thousands of musician worldwide.
        she asked for a remix of army of me, stating that the proceeds would go to the united nations children's fund
        and emergency work with children all around the world. as of january 2006, the album raised £250,000 to help
        unicef's work.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>due to the serious nature of her past two or three works, bj&#246;rk approached her next studio album with a new
        direction and objective in mind: get silly. she wanted to create something fun, something that was up and
        full-bodied. it was from this that volta was born, released on may 1 2007. volta incorporated the efforts
        of many collaborators, taking aspects from forms of music such as brass music, chinese folk music, 
        percussive tribal music, electro, malian folk music, ambient, and industrial music. she used brass
        instrumentation for almost every song on the album, most of which was courtesy of an all-female icelandic
        brass ensemble. though volta harbored favorable critical reception on release, the reception was not as
        glowing when compared to her previous albums. however, it did manage to reach top 10 on the us billboard 200,
        as it peaked at number nine. in sonic symbolism, volta is described as the following: justice, fire,
        anthropology, wanderlust, activist, brass, boats, feminist, red, neon green, electric, blue, flags, trumpets,
        tribal beats, bombastic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>bj&#246;rk's seventh studio album, biophilia, was composed as a concept album during the 2008&#8212;2011 icelandic financial crisis,
        and aimed to explore the links between nature, music, and technology. biophilia was also a multimedia project,
        which was released alongside of series of apps and a series of educational workshops. overall, the album
        grew from bj&#246;rk's interest in nature and environmentalism. biophilia was partly composed on an ipad, and new
        musical instruments were developed specifically for the album, such as the gameleste, which was a mixture between 
        a gamelan and a celesta, programmed to be played remotely by a tablet computer. biophilia was bj&#246;rk's last
        collaboration with mark bell before he sadly passed away from medical surgery complications in october 2014.
        the biophilia app contains a series of 10 separate apps, one for each song on the album. each individual app
        contains options to play the song, to access the score, use it as a karaoke machine, or use it as sheet music.
        the biophilia app was the first downloadable app in the museum of modern art's permanent collection. in sonic 
        symbolism, biophilia is described as the following: equilibrium, synchronising opposites, electric blue, copper,
        pedagogic, cosmic, atom, element table, no human scale, galaxies, nasa, not narrative, pacifist, nature/technology,
        solutions, kofi annan.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        after the success of biophilia, bj&#246;rk expressed a desire to use similar instruments for her next project.
        bj&#246;rk also approached producer arca after her manager sent her arca's mixtape, and the two worked together
        on the production of her next album, vulnicura. on january 18 2015, only a few days after the public announcement and over two months 
        ahead of its scheduled release, a full version of the album leaked online. in attempts of salvaging potential
        losses in sales, the album was released worldwide on january 20 2015. vulnicura means "cure for wounds" 
        (a combination of vulnus + curus in latin), and the album themed heavily around bj&#246;rk's breakup with barney.
        vulnicura was renowned for having much more emotionally raw and intimate lyrics compared to the more abstract
        lyrics of her previous works. additionally, despite lacking singles to promote the album, a series of
        innovative music videos were created, which culminated in the 360-degree virtual realtiy exhibit bj&#246;rk digital.
        vulnicura received widespread acclaim from critics, with many lauding it as her best output in a decade,
        compared to the comparably lukewarm reception of volta and biophilia. in sonic symbolism, vulnicura is 
        described as the following: confessional, victimhood, lieder-songs, moss tundra, greek tragedy update, 
        man-woman-conflict, chamber orchestra, lavender wax, the ritual of mourning, sewing wound, recovery narrative,
        heartbreak, shock, neon, yellow, lava.

        bj&#246;rk's next musical venture saw collaboration from ara from the start, compared to their previous collaboration,
        wherein arca joined the team after the songs and string arrangements were written. air was a conscious stylistic
        choice for the album, featuring the airy musical qualities of the flute and harp. while vulnicura was about a personal
        loss, utopia was about rediscovering love. a transcendental love, a love that's even greater. utopia released
        on november 24 2017. she described the writing of utopia to paradise, a direct opposition to the divorce-like hell
        of vulnicura, and it was further described as being "a skybound haven after her traumatic divorce".
        the album is overall an exploration of utopia, an imaginary community possessing near-perfect
        qualities for its members. hypothetical utopias focus on equality in categories such as economics, government, and
        justice, and the writing process for utopia coincided with bj&#246;rk's own personal, political, and environmental 
        concerns (while she is hesitant to be seen as an overtly political figure, bj&#246;rk is supportive of many liberation
        movements, including independence for kosovo and the international tibet independence movement). bj&#246;rk
        also described utopia as "a proposal of how society can live with nature and technology in the most optimistic
        way possible". utopia was another album met with widespread critical acclaim, being consistently lauded as
        something beautiful and avant-garde. in sonic symbolism, utopia is described as the following: sci-fi island in 
        the clouds, plant-human-bird mutant, post-apocalyptic optimism, air, flute-like synths, synth-like flutes, pacifist,
        #metoo, matriarchal, peach, mint, idealistic, women and children surviving violence, manifesto to the future,
        sensuality.

        <p>hildur rúna passed away in late 2018, and both her passing and the covid-19 pandemic had profound impacts
        on bj&#246;rk's next and most recent musical project as of writing this, fossora. fossora was released on 
        september 30 2022, and centered around the themes of isolation, loss, and grief. in the album's liner notes,
        the song sorrowful soil is subtitled "a eulogy for hildur rúna", while ancestress is subtitled "an epitaph
        for hildur rúna". fossora comes from the ungrammatical feminine version of the latin word for digger.
        the album also featured themes of survival, death, and ecological medidation, sometimes
        framed as her mushroom album. the fungus metaphor that envelops the album extends to how mushrooms are
        underground, but not stagnant in the way tree roots are. arca was intended to collaborate on fossora just
        as they had on vulnicura and utopia, but bj&#246;rk was unable to visit them in barcelona nor welcome them
        at her home due to the pandemic. though there is no sonic symbolism episode for fossora, some descriptors
        of the album are: dark green, dark red, grief, family, mushroom, digging, gabber, bass clarinet, ground.

                <li><b>utopia</b>
                    <ul><li>i adore everything about this album, from the visuals and aesthetics, to the airy
                    sounds of the flutes and harps and birds, to the meanings in the lyrics. i think it's an 
                    absolutely fantastic piece of work, and thus tops my personal ranking despite the divisive
                    view the fanbase has on it.

                <li><b>vulnicura</b>
                    <ul><li>beautifully heartbreaking. two words that absolutely encapsulate vulnicura.
                    i've actually taken it upon myself to rewrite the explanation for its ranking because
                    vulnicura has actually shifted to 2nd place, up from 4th in my ranking. i have such a
                    fondness for this album as of late, and think it's up there as some of her best work.
                    if she sinks, i'm going down with her. &hearts;

                <li><b>vespertine</b>
                    <ul><li>unsurprising that another album about love is at the top of my list, i think.
                    i adore the wintry and light direction that was taken with this album, and find so 
                    many of the songs to be absolutely breathtaking. i believe this to be one of the best albums 
                    of all time, and manages to hold up after over twenty years.

                    to say that my opinion has obviously changed since then. i find post to be such a fun album
                    to listen to, which is a big part of how i rank these. otherwise, it would be much too hard.
                    i have a lot of favorites on this album, and i think it has rightfully earned its spot
                    in third.

                </li>
                <li><b>homogenic</b>
                    <ul><li>i won't dance around it: i think homogenic is absolutely phenonemal, and another contender
                    for one of the best albums of all time. however, i just don't find myself going to play as many of the songs
                    as the past four albums. though i listen to more songs off of homogenic than i do vulnicura, another
                    thing weighing down its ranking is the version of all is full of love included on it. i just really
                    do not care for the howie b version of it, and strongly prefer the video edit.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>debut</b>
                    <ul><li>oh, debut. young, sweet debut. i feel that debut is often unfairly maligned by the fanbase, perhaps
                    because of its age. even though it's only two years younger than post, but i digress. i think a lot of the fanbase
                    nowadays struggle to give it the credit it deserves for how groundbreaking it was for music at the time, and i believe
                    it even holds up well today. i am also extremely fond of come to me, so it gets bonus points for that. but the singles
                    are also super fun. when the album is good, it's amazing. when it's mediocre... eeeeh.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>medúlla</b>
                    <ul><li>before i had more conceptualized views on her music, and when i had it hammered into me that her first four albums
                    were a no-go for claiming as my favorite album, i had settled on medúlla. which, by all means: i think that when the songs
                    on this album are good, they are phenomenal. i think desired constellation is an absolutely breathtaking song. however,
                    i don't find myself listening to a good portion of the album, which weighs down its ranking significantly despite my love
                    for multiple of the tracks.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>biophilia</b>
                    <ul><li>see, this is why doing a ranking is so difficult. already, i find myself putting an album in what is a whopping <i>eighth</i> place,
                    and even putting something there feels downright impossible. i don't dislike biophilia, not by any means. but i think the preceding seven
                    albums are more strongly attuned with my tastes. i love the artistry and innovation that surrounds this album, however.</li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>volta</b>
                    <ul><li>this is the section of the ranking where songs off these albums are few and far between on my bj&#246;rk playlist. i don't think
                    any of the songs on volta are bad. not at all. however, i find the album to be somewhat lacking in cohesion. if it were more consistent
                    in tone with songs like earth intruders and declare independence, i think i would absolutely adore it. i think that the softer, gentler
                    songs break my immersion with the fun, fiery vibes.
                    </li></ul>
                </li>
                <li><b>fossora</b>
                <ul><li>i don't want to say anything bad about fossora. i just don't think it's for me. i'm not one for getting overly fixated on negative
                emotions (which i'm also sure sounds like a bout of hypocrisy given the placement of vulnicura; but vulnicura differs in the healing strength
                the album focuses on just as much as the agony), and i think the lyrical content and themes in tandem with the genres and sounds don't do it
                for me. however, though i'm not a big fan of listening to fossora, i think fossora has some of bj&#246;rk's best lyrical work, and i applaud it for
                that.
