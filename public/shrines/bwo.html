            <h2>Plot</h2>
            <center>
        <p>the movie begins with 17-year-old ashley (olivia dejonge) driving to the lerner residence: it's her last time babysitting 12-year-old luke (levi miller) before she moves to pittsburg for college.
            while waiting for her to arrive, luke sits in his bedroom with garrett (ed oxenbould) as they bicker about luke's plan to seduce ashley using horror and fear.
            ashley arrives at the family home, and deandra (virginia madsen) shows her the pencil on luke's bedroom doorknob they are using to measure if he was sleepwalking,
            while robert (patrick warburton) takes luke to finish up his chores before they leave. deandra also catches garrett snooping around in the bathroom medicine cabinet,
            but it seems he's only looking for some itch cream for his shoulder. his parents then say goodbye, with garrett leaving as well. 
        </p><br>
        <p>luke grows increasingly frustrated as ashley rebuffs his advances in favor of talking on the phone with her boyfriend ricky (aleks mikic), and this culminates
        in him opening a bottle of champagne to get ashley's attention. after diffusing the situation, ashley goes to order food for the two of them, only to receive a
        strange phone call. despite not having ordered pizza, there's a pizza deliveryman at the door. with mushroom pizza. and luke <i>hates</i> mushrooms.
        dinner in tow, ashley returns to the couch with luke, where his unsuccessful attempts to seduce her continue as he forcefully tries to kiss her. 
        </p><br>
        <p>unsettling events continue as the household receives another strange phone call and the back door is mysteriously left open. ashley leaps into action, asking luke to toss her phone over... and he unceremoniously lands it in the fish tank.
        there's a knock at the door. and no one visible through the peephole. someone comes rushing through the door — it's just garrett, claiming he's checking up on them and denying any involvement with the creepy happenings around the house. 
        his alibi is confirmed when there's a loud crash noise that comes from upstairs. ashley immediately jumps into action, grabbing a knife to protect herself and the boys with. she tells the boys to stay down there and have 911 predialed, and goes
        upstairs to investigate. luke and garrett immediately follow her, and they investigate upstairs until they locate the source of the noise: a brick. ashley tries to call using the landline, but there's no service.
        they try to contact authorities on luke's macbook, but the home wifi isn't working. luke and ashley leave garrett in luke's bedroom to try and get online. frustrated, ashley decides they'll take her car and leave, only
        to see someone has stuck a knife in one of her tires. garrett comes downstairs, revealing a message they missed on the reverse side of the brick: u leave u die. lights flash outside, and garrett is startled, running
        outside and subsequently being shot from offscreen. a horrified ashley turns the lights off and tackles luke to the ground. trying to keep her cool, ashley formulates a new plan for herself and luke; they're going to hide
        upstairs and scream until a neighbor can hear and call the cops for them. ashley asks if luke's family has a gun, which he confirms. 
           </p><br>
        <p>with the plan in motion, ashley and luke scurry around the house, ducking by windows until the coast is clear to make their way upstairs, where there is someone patrolling the halls with a flashlight.
        they duck into the laundry room, and ashley decides they should hide up in the attic. the intruder opens the laundry room door, but they're nowhere to be found. ashley insists they stay up in the attic
        until the intruders leave, and luke feels determined to get the gun from his parents' room. ashley stumbles backwards and nearly falls from the attic, with spiders crawling all over her face: luke holds her up
        and calms her down enough to pull her to safety. they come down from the attic, and luke hugs ashley to comfort her and calm her down before leaving to get the aforementioned gun. luke then returns and pulls her
        into his bedroom, pistol in hand. the intruder opens the door to luke's bedroom and looks inside, but the two go unseen behind the door. they move into luke's closet, where luke expresses a desire to protect
        ashley. they accidentally activate a noisy light-up toy, which alerts an intruder back into luke's bedroom. huddled together in fear, ashley apologizes to luke while luke quietly pleads for the intruder to go away.
        </p><br>
        <p>but... hey, that mask the intruder is wearing looks very familiar. and it seems they have an itchy shoulder, too. enraged, ashley bursts out of the closet, yelling for garrett to take the mask off.
        she then goes on to berate luke for his idiotic scheme of seducing her with a staged break-in so that she will have sex with him; calling him a delusional infant, mental, a selfish brat, and tells him he needs lots of therapy. she then storms off to call both of their parents,
        with luke following after her, calling her name. at the top of the stairs, she finally responds, wherein luke pistol whips her in the temple and causes her to tumble down the stairs, being rendered unconscious.  
        </p><br>
        <p>when ashley comes to, she's been duct-taped to a chair with her mouth covered, and she watches as garrett rides around the house on a scooter and the boys play fuck-marry-kill with the female adventure time characters. it is
        revealed that luke has given garrett oxycontin, so garrett is now agreeable and complaisant. luke takes his phone out to reveal he is tracking his parents' location on his phone that wasn't actually taken away
        like he had claimed. ashley tries to scream and move from her bindings, which alerts the boys, who come over to sit with her. luke rummages through ashley's purse and pulls out a lipstick, with which he draws
        a pair of lips on the duct tape covering her lips. when luke takes the duct tape off, ashley attempts to reason with her captor, explaining that she thinks she has a concussion and needs to go to the hospital
        for it.</p><br>
        <p>luke, however, wants to play truth or dare, and claims that if ashley wins, he will untie her, and if she loses, he will roofie her. he asks ashley truth or dare, and ashley says truth. luke asks how
        many guys she has had sex with, to which ashley answers none, counteracting the common belief that she had sex with her ex-boyfriend, jeremy. garrett then asks luke truth or dare, and luke chooses dare, so garrett
        dares luke to grope ashley's breast. ignoring her pleas not to, luke molests her, and is subsequently ridiculed when garrett points out that he has an erection. after taunting ashley, luke tells her it's her turn,
        so ashley asks him truth or dare. luke chooses truth, and ashley asks him if garrett is aware that luke killed his hamster. this causes some discord to erupt between the two boys, and garrett expresses frustration
        that luke gets to have all the fun with ashley. disturbed, garrett walks off and luke follows him, leaving ashley alone. she discovers a flashlight on the table and wobbles over it, trying to flash a distress signal
        out of the window. she drops it when the boys come back, and luke, annoyed she cheated, mixes his roofies into a bottle of alcohol, explaining that he is going to frame her as having gotten drunk with her boyfriend
        after luke went to sleep. he tries to get ashley to drink, and she headbutts the bottle, causing it to fall onto the floor. then, the doorbell rings.</p>
        <br>
        <p>luke goes to answer the door, while garrett is left to clean up the mess from the shattered bottle. luke turns the music up to drown out ashley's screams and answers the door to ricky (aleks mikic),
        ashley's boyfriend. luke doesn't want to let him in, but ricky manages to force the door open after luke lets him pass a bouquet of flowers through the door. luke will not give a straight answer about
        where ashley is, and ricky looks around, trying to find her, going upstairs in the process. frustrated that her attempts at making noise are insufficient, ashley falls backwards onto the floor, managing
        to grab a stray shard of glass before garrett picks her back up. upstairs, ricky is looking around for ashley, and is caught off guard by shards of glass in one of the rooms, distracting him enough for luke
        to hit him over the head with a baseball bat. ricky stands back up and throws luke against the wall, and luke grabs the pencil his mother hid beneath the carpet and stabs it into ricky's face. ricky stands up
        and grabs luke's abandoned baseball bat, and is about to swing at luke when garrett comes to the rescue, holding the same shotgun he wielded while they were trying to scare ashley. while garrett is reasoning
        with ricky, luke lines up a second shot with the bat, successfully knocking ricky out. ricky is bound to a chair in matching fashion to ashley, the blood from his cheek is cleaned, and the flowers are put down
        the garbage disposal in the sink. 
        </p><br>
        <p>ashley immediately asks luke to let ricky go, and crafts a story they can tell authorities so everyone gets off scott free. luke isn't having it. the seeds of doubt have been planted in garrett, however.
        ashley then asks why ricky didn't listen, saying that she said she would text him. ricky replies that she did text him, where it is revealed that luke texted ricky to get him to come over,
        planting another seed of doubt in garrett's head that luke's plan didn't stop at the scaring ashley scheme. luke tells garrett to take a walk and chill out, so garrett smokes some of the weed he was given by
        his brother. alone with ashley and ricky, luke unveils the next step of his plan: inviting ex-boyfriend jeremy over. holding the gun to ashley's chest, he demands that she invites jeremy over. she refuses,
        and luke eventually concedes, calling jeremy with the landline phone. he manages to convince jeremy to come over by saying that ashley wants to speak to him in person. ashley again tries to reason with luke,
        bringing up how sad luke was when he had accidentally killed garrett's hamster. luke whispers to her that it wasn't an accident, which prompts ricky to mumble something. he needs the bathroom, and urinates in
        his pants. luke freaks out and immediately cleans it up, bringing the garbage bag outside and leaving the couple by themselves. ashley springs into action, cutting at the tape binding her with the shard of glass
        she grabbed earlier. ricky wants her to worry about herself and leave him behind, and goes on to encourage her bright and shining future, even if he isn't a part of it. luke then comes back inside.</p>
        <br>
        <p>bored by how far away jeremy lives, luke has a new idea to pass the time: he wants to watch ashley and jeremy fuck. still unconvinced about the status of ashley's virginity, he remarks that ricky 
        likely has sex with ashley twice a day. quickly, luke plays everything off as a joke, and realizes that the strong scent inside wasn't ricky's urine, but the weed garrett was smoking. the two boys bicker offscreen,
        and ashley continues cutting at her binds. luke returns, holding garret's joint, and tries to get ricky to smoke it. ricky refuses, so luke threatens him at gunpoint. ricky relents, taking a hit, and smoke seeps
        out of the hole in his cheek, which fascinates luke and garrett; luke holds his nostrils and mouth shut to force the smoke out through his cheek, explaining that they need to get the weed in ricky's system.
        luke then drags ricky's chair beneath the staircase, grabbing a rope and a paint can from a side room and going upstairs. ashley continues sawing at her tape binds with the glass. luke then throws the paint can
        down to the floor below, almost hitting ricky in the process as the can swings back and forth on the rope; he throws down one of his father's ties, telling garrett to blindfold ricky with it. ashley manages to
        free herself, and runs to the staircase holding the gun. she tells luke to put the paint can down, or she will shoot him. luke obliges, sending it on a trajectory straight into ricky's head, killing him. luke is amazed by
        his experiment, and ashley is enraged, attempting to fire the gun as a warning shot. but... it's not loaded. ashley runs outside, tripping over the wire used to stage garrett's fake death earlier. garrett chases after her, trying to reason with her to come back inside. ashley fights back, knocking garrett's glasses
        off and breaking them in the process. the two fight, and ashley manages to tear the chair from her arm. she runs and vaults over the fence into another backyard, and tries to run to carollers for help. luke
        incapacitates her with the u leave, u die brick. 
        </p><br>
        <p>when ashley comes to once again, she's completely tied up with duct tape and christmas lights, her mouth once again taped over. luke listens to the carollers outside, sending them off with fresh hot cocoa.
        garrett expresses further doubt with luke and his plans, and luke brings up successful incidents in the past in attempts to reel him back in, insisting that the two of them will get out of this clean so long
        as garrett follows what luke says to do. luke fakes a post on one of ashley's social media accounts using her phone, saying, “why can't exes just go away? jeremy is, like, freaking me out”. he then leaves to
        prepare for jeremy's arrival, leaving garrett alone with ashley. she tries to communicate with garrett, but he doesn't want to hear any of it, fully broken by the events of the night. jeremy (dacre montgomery)
        is sitting in his car, sipping from a bottle of beer, hyping himself up for his talk with ashley. he goes through the back, just like luke told him to, and meets the young lerner boy face to face. garrett covers
        ashley's mouth so she can't scream for jeremy to hear, and ashley uses the eye contact to her advantage, communicating with garrett using only her eyes; she pleads for him to untie her. outside, luke asks jeremy
        to take a seat on a swingset, which receives a fair amount of pushback. he manages to convince jeremy to write down an apology note, reading, “dear ashley, i'm so sorry. please forgive me for everything i've
        done. i love you so much.” when jeremy announces he is finished, luke throws a noose around his neck, driving a riding lawnmower to hang jeremy at the swingset, killing him and leaving his apology note at the
        scene of the crime as a suicide note. inside, garrett claims he wants the night to be over. ashley reaches out her hand through her binds to garrett's, holding his fingers and staring into his eyes to beg. garrett takes the tape off of ashley's
        mouth, and she affirms to garrett that he is a good person that simply didn't know what luke was capable of. ashley insists that she won't let luke hurt him, and garrett, uncomfortable, attempts to clarify that
        luke is his best friend. ashley isn't convinced, and skillfully explains how luke uses and manipulates garrett, which finally gets him to concede and begin cutting her free of her binds. garrett innocently kisses
        her cheek, and is subsequently blown across the room by the blast of the shotgun.</p>
        <br>
        <p>luke is furious that garrett touched his property, screaming about how he told garrett not to touch her. garrett tries to scream for help, which enrages luke more. he aims the shotgun at him,
        and garrett stammers that he wants his mom. luke fires, killing his best friend. luke then erupts into a full-on tantrum, screaming, “fuck you” at garrett's corpse multiple times. after calming down,
        he flatly states that garrett was starting to annoy him, anyways. luke then pulls up a chair to sit next to ashley, who has realized she was never going to escape. he affirms this, and goes on to explain
        how his mother used to tuck him in and hold him tightly; she suddenly stopped, and luke doesn't understand why, but he's unable to sleep well because of it. ashley says she knows exactly why his mother stopped
        and then completely shuts off, closing her eyes and fully accepting her fate. this upsets luke, who demands her attention: for her to open her eyes, to look at him, to tell him he's fucked up or what she's disappointed,
        that she's scared or she wants to go home, something. but she doesn't. seeing that his favorite toy has malfunctioned and is beyond repair, luke takes out a switchblade and stabs ashley in the neck, telling her goodnight
        and kissing her on top of the head before going to clean up all of the events of the night. his plan is to frame a jealous jeremy for the murders of ricky, garrett, and ashley. after staging the perfect crime scene,
        luke tucks himself into bed and waits for his parents to come inside and see the horror.</p>
        <br>
        <p>upon entrance, deandra screams and comes rushing up the stairs, horrified by the scene downstairs and frightened for her son. luke is safe and sound in bed, and she finally holds in her arms, just like he wanted. the
        two sit in luke's room as paramedics and police outside discuss the horrors downstairs, and luke smiles, satisfied with his succesful plan. until a paramedic exclaims that <i>this one's still alive</i>. luke rushes
        to the window, where he sees ashley being wheeled into an ambulance. the paramedics explain to one another that she used duct tape to stem the bleeding from the stab wound in her neck, and ashley, with the last bit 
        of her strength, manages to give luke the middle finger. deandra comes back to hold luke once again, just as he wanted, but his happiness was very short lived.</p>
        <br>
        <p>in a mid-credits scene, luke expresses concern for ashley, and says he wants to go visit her in the hospital.</p>

        <help>
        <ul>
            <li>the lerner family lives on 312 claremont lane, winnetka, illinois. this is likely a reference to the setting of <i>home alone</i>, as it also takes place in and was filmed in winnetka.</li>
            </li>
            <li>despite being set in the united states, <i>better watch out</i> was filmed in australia during its summer. all of the cast except for the parents are australian.</li>
            <li>the doorhandles are 1.44m above the ground, standard for an older australian home and a massive source of frustration for director chris peckover during production.</li>
            <li>there are real australian huntsman spiders used in the spider scenes; olivia dejonge offered to do the scenes practically so they wouldn't have to be cut due to cgi costs, despite her own arachnophobia.</li>
            <li>robyn dejonge, olivia's mother, and jamie oxenbould, ed's father, both receive shoutouts in the special thanks to section of the credits.</li><br>
            <li>olivia dejonge and ed oxenbould previously played siblings in <i>the visit</i>.</li><br>
            <li>garrett is playing <i>the forest</i> in luke's room.</li><br>
            <li>in the music playing during luke's monologue and when he stabs ashley (open your eyes), you can hear the sounds of luke's womb noise machine.</li><br>
            <li>ricky brings ashley stargazer lilies.</li><br>
            <li>the original script was much darker in tone, bordering on torture porn, and the character of garrett was only in the initial bedroom scene.</li><br>
            <li>the film was originally titled <i>safe neighborhood</i>.</li><br>
            <li>the scene of robert and his camp christmas ornaments wasn't in the script, instead being suggested by patrick warburton, who supplied his own ornaments.</li><br>
            <li>selena gomez's reps wanted her to play the role of ashley back in 2014 before her music career took off.</li><br>
            <li>dacre montgomery personally chose jeremy's outfit.</li><br>
            <li>the snow shown in the film is made of gelatin and paper.</li><br>
            <li>chris was originally considering ed oxenbould for the role of luke.</li><br>
            <li>while it isn't stated <a href="https://ihorror.com/horror-pride-month-writer-director-chris-peckover/">in the film</a>, chris wrote garrett as being gay and closeted.</li>

            <p>the lyrics in <b>limp</b> are resonant to me of how ashley views luke.
            <i>you wanna lick my wounds, don't you, baby? / you want the badge
            of honour when you save my hide.</i> refers to how luke wants to
            orchestrate the image of him as a hero and him as ashley's protector.
            <i>but you're the one in the way of the day of doom, baby.</i> referring to how
            luke is the one pulling the strings of the so-called day of doom, being the staged
            home invasion. however, the day of doom can also a hold a double meaning in that
            it will be luke's day of doom when ashley reveals the truth after the events of the
            film. the chorus feels generally relevant to ashley's mindset and rightful vindication
            towards luke. <i>you feed the beast i have within me</i> offers relevance in how luke
            provokes ashley's behavior that is dissimilar to who she purported to be at the beginning
            of the film; not the sweet and polite girl interacting with luke's parents, nor the giggling
            lover girl speaking on the phone with ricky. she is someone vulgar and abrasive forced into
            action. <i>standing on the sidelines, waving and grinning</i> such as how after killing ricky,
            luke responds not with horror, but with laughter and glee, furthermore standing on the sidelines
            as he descends the staircase. <i>you fondle my trigger, then you blame my gun</i> relates in how
            luke engages in behavior specifically intended to rile ashley up — harassing her, insulting her,
            assaulting her — but ultimately blames her for her reactions and feelings.

        lyrics that i once again find related to ashley's experiences in the film's duration.
        the music has a sinister, uncomfortable feel, which relates to how viscerally uncomfortable
        ashley is throughout the film, having her boundaries constantly disregarded, ignored, and
        trampled upon by the men onscreen. <i>a baseball bat, a baseball bat</i> is the weapon used
        to knock out ricky in order to bind him to a chair like ashley. <i>i am alone, you win again
        / i'm paralyzed</i> hearkens to her state before luke stabs her in the neck, alone and surrounded
        by the corpses of ricky, jeremy, and garrett; luke has won because ashley has no fight left
        to give. <i>a psychopath, he says he loves me</i> relates to ashley's experiences in a similar
        way. while i'm not using this space to speculate upon luke's mental health status, ashley
        nevertheless views him as someone damaged and unwell, and it's evident that the events of
        the night played out as they did to punish ashley for not giving herself up to him, i.e.
        how luke could purport to love her. <i>and i'm alone, and i am cold / and paralyzed / i can't move</i>
        once again refers to ashley's state before and during luke's attempted killing of her, trapped
        in  the chair until she is rescued by authorities.

    <p> His little whispers, "Love me, love me"<br>

    <p> Monster, how should I feel?<br>

    the lyrics of monster tend to lend themselves more to a depiction of luke's actions and
    experiences much more so than ashley's, but the vibe feels correct for my ashley section
    nonetheless: arguably, it is her mental retelling of the events. that she knows luke is
    only seeking love, specifically the love he stopped receiving from his mother. in that way,
    <i>he battered his tiny fists to feel something / wondered what it's like to touch and
    feel something</i> hearkens to how luke seeks out ashley as a proxy for his own mother,
    having lost that physical affection and affirmation from her some time ago. <i>looking
    through the windows</i> is a tongue-in-cheek way to point out the end of the movie, wherein
    luke is wistfully looking out of his window at the ambulance a living ashley is being wheeled
    into. <i>that night he caged her, bruised and broke her</i> refers to the torment ashley underwent
    from luke, caging her inside of his house. <i>violate wrists and then her ankles, silent pain</i> are
    the locations where she was duct-taped to the chair. <i>then he slowly saw their nightmares were his dreams</i>
    finally may refer to luke's glee at ricky's death in contrast to ashley and garrett's unadulterated
    horror.

<p>
again, going under feels relevant to ashley's righteous anger as a result of the film's events.
<i>don't want your hand this time, i'll save myself</i> firstly hearkens to ashley's frustration
with the staged home invasion, rejecting luke's attempts at false manhood and protection in
favor of being the hero of her own story. the pre-chorus and chorus can refer to ashley's views
on her apparent and imposing death, going under in the sense of losing her life. <i>blurring 
and stirring the truth and the lies / so i don't know what's real and what's not</i> and truthfully
the entirety of the second verse lends itself to how luke consistently gaslights ashley throughout
the film, trying to make her doubt her perception of reality. <i>so go on and scream / scream at
me, i'm so far away / i won't be broken again</i> refers to ashley shutting down and embracing her impending fate,
refusing to give luke the attention he craves from her; she is worlds away from luke, no matter how
much of a tantrum he throws.

        Ooh, baby, ooh, said ooh</p><br>
        
        <p>And the days go by, like a strand in the wind<br>
        In the web that is my own, I begin again<br>
        Said to my friend, baby (everything stopped)<br>
        Nothin' else mattered</p><br>
        
        <p>He was no more than a baby then<br>
        Well he seemed broken-hearted<br>
        Something within him<br>
        But the moment that I first laid<br>
        Eyes on him, all alone<br>
        On the edge of seventeen</p><br>
        
        <p>Just like the white winged dove<br>

        <p>Well, I went today<br>
        Maybe I will go again tomorrow<br>
        Yeah yeah, well, the music there<br>
        Well, it was hauntingly familiar<br>
        Well, I see you doing what I try to do for me<br>
        With the words from a poet and a voice from a choir<br>
        And a melody, and nothing else mattered</p><br>

        But the sea changes colours<br>
        But the sea does not change<br>
        So with the slow, graceful flow of age<br>
        I went forth with an age old desire to please<br>
        On the edge of seventeen</p><br>
        
        <p>Just like the white winged dove<br>

        Left standing in the hall, yeah, yeah<br>
        In a flood of tears<br>
        That no one really ever heard fall at all</p><br>
        
        <p>Well, I went searchin' for an answer<br>
        Up the stairs and down the hall<br>
        And not to find an answer<br>
        Just to hear the call<br>
        Of a nightbird singing, "Come away"<br>
        (Come away, come away)</p><br>
        
        <p>Just like the white winged dove<br>

        And I hear you at nightfall<br>
        Sometimes to be near you<br>
        Is to be unable to feel you, my love<br>
        I'm a few years older than you<br>
        (I'm a few years older than you) my love</p><br>

i actually saw an edit of ashley to this song, which started my association of it with her.
but it definitely feels right, even down to how i see ashley represented somewhat in the color
white due to her sweater. moreover, <i>just like the white winged dove</i> also lends itself
to youth and innocence, and how ashley desperately tries to cling to her youth before leaving
for college. <i>he was no more than a baby then / well he seemed broken-hearted</i> reflects
ashley's view of luke, as she views him as someone very young, and someone troubled and
ultimately broken. <i>on the edge of seventeen</i> is ashley's very experience in the film,
as she is stated to be five years older than luke, who is 12 (and 13 in a few weeks). to be
on the edge of seventeen can also refer to her ephemeral place between youth and adulthood,
in the apotheosis of her transitional stage before she leaves for college.

the first thing i want to point out is how luke has a hit the lights poster in his
bedroom, visible in the initial scenes with garrett as they bicker about paint cans
and luke's apparent plan to seduce ashley. this is the hit the lights song i find
most relevant to luke's character. for instance, <i>it makes me so hard to ignore / cause
i could never keep your attention</i> can refer to luke's frustration that, at the beginning
of the night, ashley continuously dismisses him in favor of calling ricky. <i>i pray you die
slowly so i can be the last thing you see</i> speaks not only to the suffering he wishes to
inflict onto ashley (granted that he opts for a manner that would take longer to kill ashley
rather than the methods he employed for ricky, jeremy, and garrett), but also his general possessiveness
over her, having slaughtered every other man in the movie that displays any sort of romantic attraction
or affection towards her. in general, the song displays feelings of control and possessiveness
that suits luke and his attitude and sense of entitlement towards ashley.

<p>
    On some nights you'll find me falling<br>
    I am formless I am shapeless<br>
    And on some nights I'm better left alone<br>
    You take it all in from some severed state of stasis<br>
    You scream, "wake up", inside your own body but<br>
    You're buried or suffocating or worse<br>
    Tonight it's worse<br>
    Tonight the screaming hurts<br>
    Tonight it's worse</p><br>
<p>
    Tonight I'm wrapped up in her<br>
    We find each other under<br>
    Blankets as warm as summer<br>
    We are inseparable<br>
    Our bodies know what they're for<br>
    And we give in, we explore<br>
    Each other desperate for<br>
    Something inseparable</p><br>
<p>
    This coma kiss is infinite<br>
    And I may take your tongue if you stay<br>
    We are this dream - fluid and intricate<br>
    We made it that way<br>
    Every nightmare needs an influence<br>
    And your body turning blue as you lay<br>
    Directly next to me colors this one<br>
    In bluish hues and darker grays</p><br>
<p>
    (It's in the center of my torso, behind my eyes and in the back of my head<br>
    Something is eating me alive from the inside out)</p><br>
<p>
    And everyday when I awake I'm shaking or worse<br>
    Tonight it's worse<br>
    Tonight the screaming hurts<br>
    Tonight it's worse</p><br>
<p>
    Last night as I was wrapped up in her<br>
    I drowned her body under<br>
    Blankets as warm as summer<br>
    We were inseparable<br>
    So this is what has become<br>
    Of everything that I loved<br>
    The betrayal and the blood<br>
    Became inseparable<br>
    From the most beautiful nightmare I've ever had<br>
    Completely inseparable</p><br>
<p>
    I see her hair spread across the floor<br>
    And tangled in the telephone cord<br>
    Our favorite song's been repeating all night<br>
    Someone call an ambulance, because something's not right</p>
</div><br>
<center>
<p>
much like the other songs in luke's section, dreaming delves into themes of unhealthy obsession
turned violent. <i>so this is what has become / of everything that i loved</i> can interestingly not only
refer to his attempt on ashley's life, but his killing of garrett. luke started better watch out with
one possession (garrett), tried to gain another (ashley), and ultimately lost both in his greed and lust
for attention. <i>i see her hair spread across the floor</i> can refer to the state of ashley after
luke pistol whips her and causes her to fall down the stairs, rendering her unconscious. <i>someone
call an ambulance, because something's not right</i> is exactly what happens when deandra and rob come home
from their night out, however it is luke's timing in orchestrating the events of the night that allows
for the ambulance team to stabilize ashley and ultimately help her to survive. also, dreaming is
befitting of luke in a vibe sort of way, similar in sound to hit the lights and that general
misogynistic pop-punk era of music.

<p>
the first thing i want to highlight is how "in the bathroom is where i want you" by nightmare
of you perfectly encapsulates luke's manipulative and predatory behavior in the movie. for
instance, <i>i want to do a little, i want to do it all</i> reflects luke's escalating desires
and willingness to push boundaries with ashley. his manipulative tactics and deceptive charm
are mirrored in the lyrics <i>wait, wait, i'm a gentleman-in-training, wait, wait, i'm a
professional in feigning love</i>. the line <i>in the bathroom is where i want you, against
the graffiti walls we know no love at all</i> speaks to luke's obsession with controlling and
dominating ashley, starkly represented by the desire to be in a confined, intimate space where
he can impose his will. the imagery of graffiti walls adds a layer of rebellion and depravity, highlighting
luke's complete disregard for moral boundaries. <i>and just to see your body in a place so
tacky, there's no better irony in my own depravity</i> further emphasizes luke's twisted
satisfaction in corrupting innocence and creating chaos. his actions throughout the film,
from orchestrating the staged home invasion to his violent outbursts, showcase his deep-seated
depravity and the perverse pleasure he derives from it.

<p>
    I spent most of last night dragging this lake<br>
    For the corpses of all my past mistakes<br>
    Sell me out, the joke's on you, we are salt and you are<br>
    The wound<br>
    Empty another bottle and let me tear you to pieces<br>
    This is me wishing you into the worst situations<br>
    I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go, but you<br>
    Wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and slit your throat</p><br>
<p>
    Whoa, whoa, ooh<br>
    Whoa, whoa</p><br>
<p>
    Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears, rather ones that just don't care<br>
    Cause I know that you're in between arms, somewhere<br>
    Next to heartbeats where you shouldn't dare sleep<br>
    Now, I'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me</p><br>
<p>
    Take your taste back<br>
    Peel back your skin<br>
    And try to forget how it feels inside<br>
    You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while<br>
    Take your taste back<br>
    Peel back your skin<br>
    And try to forget how it feels inside<br>
    You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while</p><br>
<p>
    And did you hear the news? I could dissect you and<br>
    Gut you on this stage not as eloquent as I may have imagined<br>
    But it will get the job done, and you're<br>
    Done...<br>
    Every line is plotted and designed to leave you<br>
    Standing on your bedroom window's ledge<br>
    And everyone else that it hits, that it gets to<br>
    Is nothing more than collateral damage</p><br>
<p>
    Take your taste back<br>
    Peel back your skin<br>
    And try to forget how it feels inside<br>
    You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while<br>
    Take your taste back<br>
    Peel back your skin<br>
    And try to forget how it feels inside<br>
    You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while</p>

another pop-punk adjacent song with themes of harming and hatred towards women,
what a surprise! <i>we are salt - and you are the wound</i> speaks to luke's
role in exacerbating the pain and chaos in ashley's life. his actions
throughout the night, including the violent methods he employs to eliminate
ricky, jeremy, and garrett, highlight his intent to be the source of ashley's
suffering, much like salt intensifies the pain of a wound. <i>i could dissect
you and gut you on the stage</i> further illustrates luke's ruthless and
calculating nature, wishing to humiliate ashley through the events of the night.
tormenting her. molesting her. attempting to drug her. taunting her about the sex
she is allegedly having. the line <i>empty another bottle and let me tear you to
pieces</i> demonstrates luke's willingness to destroy ashley emotionally and physically.
his sadistic pleasure in her pain is evident as he relentlessly pursues his twisted goals,
firstly of actively pursuing her and then of punishing her for her transgression of rejecting him.
<i>i'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go</i> underscores luke's inability to move on
from perceived slights and his obsessive need for control. his fixation on ashley and
determination to dominate her life drive the narrative of the film. <i>take your taste back,
peel back your skin and try to forget how it feels inside</i> reflects luke's desire to
strip away ashley's defenses and expose her vulnerabilities. his psychological manipulation
and physical threats are aimed at breaking her down, a plan which ultimately fails, as ashley
shuts down willingly in order to face death with dignity.

    Don't be upset now<br>

immediately, <i>you can't escape now, i've got you locked inside this room</i> refers to how
luke has trapped ashley inside of his home. initially, she is trapped inside by a perceived threat,
but later on is physically restrained from leaving. the line <i>this is what you get when
you're talking back baby</i> encapsulates luke's punitive nature. any resistance or defiance
from ashley is met with harsh punishment, reflecting the song's theme of retribution and
control. luke's actions throughout the night, including his violent outbursts, showcase his
need to assert dominance and crush any semblance of rebellion, a bitter pairing coupled alongside
ashley's defiant and headstrong nature. <i>no one hears you in this room</i> can refer not only to
how ashley spends much of the film with duct tape covering her lips, preventing her from speaking,
but also in how luke uses loud christmas music to muffle any and all noises of ashley screaming from an
intruding ricky. <i>open up your eyes, i want to watch you cry</i>
further illustrates luke's sadistic pleasure in ashley's suffering. his enjoyment of her
pain and tears is a direct reflection of the song's dark and voyeuristic undertones. luke's
desire to watch ashley suffer highlights his complete lack of empathy and his twisted sense
of gratification. also, open your eyes is a line repeated multiple times by luke during the film,
both in a protective manner, and in a malicious manner. he initially shouts at her to open her eyes
when she is about to fall from the attic, screaming in fear over the spiders on her face. his final time
shouting at her to open her eyes is when his plaything malfunctions, cutting him off from his source
of attention and the proxy of his mother. <i>now i'm a changed man / but as a boy i was so true</i>
hearkens to luke's deceptions, as he spends much of the film trying desperately to prove that he is mature,
that he is literally a changed man. also, another song i view as something luke personally listening to.

            sticking out of the bushes, reaching lethargically for
            nothing. There is no helping Garrett.
            She covers her mouth, suppressing a DELAYED MOAN from the
            horror of it all. And sits there, momentarily catatonic...</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>Ashley’s eyes roll to Luke, who’s trembling, wiping away
            tears, and it hits her: she is the adult here. She can’t
            freak out in front of him. She swallows her breath.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Shhh, Luke, we’re not gonna die.
            But I need your help. I need you
            to stay calm and we’re going to get

        <blockquote><p>She looks up at Luke, the boy she was supposed to protect.

            wipes a tear from her cheek as the dryer tumbles beside them.</p></blockquote>
        <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Luke, I’m sorry... I- I couldn’t
        protect you...&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p> &mdash; Ashley</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Luke, listen to me, I’ve known you
        since you were eight. I taught you
        how to play baseball. You have
        threatened me with a gun tonight,
        this is not okay.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p> &mdash; Ashley</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Luke hesitates, momentarily betraying his pre-adolescent
        nervousness... Then slips his hand under her shirt and
        squeezes around. Ashley looks away in disgust.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;Shut THE FUCK UP. You’re a whore.
        You’re a whore who uses people to
        get what you want.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p> &mdash; Luke</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Ashley stares right back, unblinking. But behind the
        clenched jaw, she’s scared. Wheels spinning - how do I get
        out of this?</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Garrett stares at the gun. Doesn’t like holding it. Puts it
        on the counter as he uses a towel to pick up the glass. He
        dumps it in the trash and looks at Ashley.
        Without Luke here, staring at this tied up girl, this all
        feels - icky.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;I'm not leaving you here.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p> &mdash; Ashley</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>LUKE HAS CRACKED. Some long-dormant dysfunction finally
        awakened. This is the happiest moment of his life.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Nope. Ashley VAULTS over it effortlessly while Garrett slams
        into the wooden slats. Not a hero, just a cheerleader.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Ashley nods, looks up at him. He raises a dubious eyebrow.
        But Ashley stares back - broken, defeated. The fight gone
        from her eyes. Luke has won.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>She stares
        at the splash of yellow down the hall. Beginning to process
        that Ricky is truly gone.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>Ashley screams for help,
        but what little sound she makes through her gag gets SILENCED
        when Garrett covers her mouth.
        Ashley stops screaming. Holds Garrett’s gaze.
        As his hand muffles any chance of Ashley’s escape, the truth
        of the moment hits him and his eyes brim with tears -
        Garrett has lost himself tonight.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>He punches the wall, punches the counter, rushes into the
        family room and beats the couch, screaming more obscenities
        into the pillows.
        Ashley watches, the events of the evening leaving her unmoved
        by Luke’s rage. It is just a child’s temper tantrum.</p></blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>&OpenCurlyDoubleQuote;That’s all I want, Ash. Someone to
        hold on to. Someone- permanent.&CloseCurlyDoubleQuote;</p> &mdash; Luke</blockquote>
    <blockquote><p>ASHLEY CLOSES HER EYES. Leaving Luke, leaving this place for
        somewhere far, far away. It’s the only control she has left.</p></blockquote>

        <h2>Analysis</h2>
        <center>
        <p>this page may analyze themes typically viewed as transgressive: my analysis is not inherently an endorsement, but the nature of
better watch out is transgressive in and of itself.
        </p><br>
<details>
<summary>men, women, and chain saws: her body, himself</summary>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Slasher is atypical to the genres one would typically allocate to Better Watch Out: home invasion, perhaps, if you wished to belie the major twist of the movie when advertising to potential viewers, and psychological horror thereafter; the descriptor of holiday horror would not be remiss in either circumstance. However, it stands to reason that even if not a slasher in designated genre nor in general atmosphere, Better Watch Out manages to embody many of the characteristics that make slasher films an enjoyable and riveting watch. Let it be known, the only mask that the killer wears is emotional, not somatic, and there are no massive groups of scantily-clad teenagers slaughtered for general audience enjoyment.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">As Carol J. Clover describes of <em>Psycho</em> in Men, Women, and Chain Saws, “its elements are familiar: the killer is the psychotic product of a sick family, but still recognizably human; the victim is a beautiful, sexually active woman; the location is not-home at a Terrible Place; the weapon is something other than a gun; the attack is registered from the victim’s point of view and comes with shocking suddenness” (Clover 24). This, too, belies multiple of the story elements found in <em>Better Watch Out</em>: Ashley’s virginity is stated multiple times, a gun is used to kill, and the killer is arguably not entirely psychotic nor stemming from sick family so much as empowered by his sexual dysfunction and male entitlement. However, should we “survey the genre by component category: killer, locale, weapons, victims, and shock effects” (Clover 26), the collation of <em>Better Watch Out</em> as a slasher more easily comes to light.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">The killer in a slasher film is arguably one of its most recognizable assets, apart from the trope and conception of the final girl, even in spite of said killers typically only showing their true selves late into said films. Luke Lerner, though remaining the same in bodily form, is not necessarily an exception to such a reading; at almost 33 minutes into its runtime, by way of pistol whipping Ashley and causing her to fall down the staircase and be rendered unconscious, Luke strips off the mask concealing his identity, revealing his true self. Luke is, like many a killer, “propelled by psychosexual fury” (Clover 27), not only motivated by a precocious passion for Ashley but also by a late-revealed and generally encompassing Oedipal attitude. A son “in the psychosexual grip of [his] mother” (Clover 49), Luke’s attachment to his mother is depicted in multiple facets throughout the film: in his usage of a womb noise machine at nearly 13 years old, in his lamenting how his mother no longer holds him tightly after tucking him in, how his attraction manifests towards another older, authoritative woman in his life. Moreover, his mother consistently dotes over him. She is the one instructing Ashley on minutiae about him, such as how he has been sleepwalking again, how she wishes for her to keep an eye on bad influence Garrett while babysitting, how he needs his sleeping pill before he goes to sleep. She dotes, and she dotes to the degree that Luke is deluded by his entitlement, deluded into thinking he’s someone much more intelligent, someone much more cunning and capable than he truly is. Luke’s attachment to his mother is even lampshaded by Garrett asking if he learned that a vagina being “sticky and moist and shit” was a pro from her.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Additionally, the Lerner family is evidently nowhere near the horror boasted by families of slasher killers, not that of <em>Psycho</em> nor the <em>Chain Saw</em> films, it stands to reason that there is still discontentment rife within the family dynamic. Luke’s parents bicker, and when he is asked by Ashley with what his family’s plans for the holidays are, Luke’s response is merely that of “Drinking and arguing”. That knowledge, combined with how Luke’s mother is drinking prior to their leaving to some unimportant holiday party, showcases how there is more than meets the eye to an otherwise stable-looking suburban family.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Clover furthermore states that, “Even killers whose childhood is not immediately at issue and who display no overt gender confusion are often sexually disturbed” (Clover 28), something that continuously resonates regarding Luke. His sexuality is relatively precocious — though not necessarily in development, as precocious sexuality is classically defined as being before the age of nine in boys, and additionally not necessarily in consumption of pornography, wherein multiple sources have stated the average age of first consumption to be 12 years old in boys — in his desire and willingness to act on said sexuality. Our first introduction to Luke is him reading an article detailing how to, in essence, turn a girl on, something appearing as supplementary detailing to a broader plan of having sex with Ashley. He not only formulates said plan, but orchestrates it in a way to manipulate her hormones to his benefit; something that, when coupled alongside the target of said plan being an older woman in a position of authority over him, speaks easily to Luke’s being sexually disturbed. Though he is seemingly upfront in his sexual wants and desires, his body belies his cunningness and confidence. When Luke gets an erection after sexually assaulting Ashley by way of groping one of her breasts, he is subsequently embarrassed by Garrett bringing attention to it; his embarrassment is juvenile given that erections are an involuntary and natural bodily response.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Moreover, Luke follows the typical depiction of a slasher killer in how his “masculinity is severely qualified” (Clover 45). Though he is coming of age himself, he is nevertheless trapped in a perpetual boyhood that fights in collusion with his dichotomous desire to be perceived as a man. He dresses himself in a manner depicting himself as well-kept, sporting a maroon jumper over a blue chequered collared shirt that contrasts with Garrett’s unkempt black hoodie. He boasts about things like sex and alcohol, perceiving those things as making him look more mature. He even brings up Ashley allegedly having cramps due to her menses as an excuse to Ricky, though this being intentioned as depicting him in a mature manner is perhaps justified when Ricky’s subsequent asking Ashley if she has tampons to quell her cramping woes comes into question. “His fury is unmistakably sexual in both roots and expression” (Clover 42), and Luke’s entire issue with his perceived boyishness is that it is Ashley perceiving him as boyish and, ultimately, as a child. Granted, Ashley is entirely justified in doing so: not only is his meagre age of 13 the biggest contributing factor in such a viewpoint, but there are other reminders of his youth consistently shown throughout Better Watch Out. Luke’s voice cracks a fair bit throughout his night of imposed terror, a persistent reminder of the changes puberty brings onto his body. He still has colourful height indicators scrawled onto his doorframe. He still sleeps using the womb noise machine to lull him. He has an adoration for <em>Adventure Time</em> that is referenced not only in the home wifi network being FinnAndJake, but also in how the female princesses of the show are immediately brought up for a game of Fuck, Marry, Kill. And, most significantly of all, one of Luke’s greatest trigger areas is Ashley referring to him as a child. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Though we see Ashley in the beginning of the film driving to the Lerner residence, it is Luke, sporting his civilian mask, that is posited as our protagonist. “We are linked [...] with the killer in the early part of the film [...] before we have come to know the Final Girl in any detail” (Clover 44), and we are giving a heaping pile of details regarding Luke in the form of his introductory scene. Even his bedroom serves to contextualise his boyishness; there are G.I. Joe action figure dolls and toy cars lining his shelves, there are posters about video games and zombies embellishing his walls, an abandoned puzzle beneath his bed. The intimate look into his bedroom shares with the audience the exact type of person that Luke purports to be, or, perhaps, the person Luke was before his familial issues took hold.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Ashley’s womanhood in general seems to elicit a fair amount of rage from Luke, especially where it pertains to her sexuality. He is relatively obsessed with the idea of Ashley having sex, and not even necessarily with him. In almost every circumstance, the detailing of his obsession isn’t even solely about himself. When Luke puerilely elects to play truth or dare with Garrett and a duct tape-restrained Ashley, the first truth he offers Ashley to answer is how many guys she has slept with. This is a question that Luke already perceives himself as knows the answer to, granted that he immediately rebuts Ashley’s answer of “None” with the apparent knowledge that she had “screwed Jeremy”. He further presses the issue of Ashley’s sexuality once he restrained Ricky in a manner similar to Ashley, declaring that he wanted to watch them fuck to pass the time before Jeremy arrived. Additionally, Luke seems dissatisfied with Ashley’s answer, as he gets a second opinion on the area of her virginity from Ricky, stating his belief that they have sex twice a day withal. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">This apparent proclivity towards penetrative sex where Ashley is involved falls apart where Luke is directly involved. Luke’s groping of Ashley, as horrific as it is, is as far as his sexual misconduct gets. When Clover states, “Actual rape is practically nonexistent in the slasher film [...] violence and sex are not concomitants but alternatives, the one as much a substitute for and a prelude to the other” (Clover 29), Luke using violence as a sexual proxy and substitute is wildly apparent. There are minimum two instances where Ashley is unconscious and Luke could hypothetically rape her should that be something he sought in actuality — both when she is rendered unconscious after being pistol whipped and falling down the stairs, and when she is rendered unconscious after being hit with the brick — but he, as far as we the audience are aware, doesn’t. However, Luke does have the roofies that he refers to as his insurance policy, and granted that it is something he would have to obtain separately, apart from his manufactured plan of the night, it’s difficult to ascertain whether raping Ashley was necessarily a plan for him or not. That being said, Luke is also depicted to be incredibly possessive over Ashley, to the point where he shoots and kills Garrett for touching her and attempting to free her. It is thereby possible that Luke did not want to rape Ashley while she was unconscious due to Garrett being over, not wanting to share what he viewed as his possession and his conquest.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">The locale of <em>Better Watch Out</em> is analogous to the “Terrible Place”  outlined by Clover (30), wherein she further elucidates how “the house or tunnel may at first seem a safe haven, but the same walls that promise to keep the killer out quickly become, once the killer penetrates them, the walls that hold the victim in” (31). The Lerner residence of 312 Claremont Lane is absolutely a safe haven, even in how Luke describes his family as living in a “really safe neighbourhood”. Ashley has babysat for them before, and it is therefore a familiar location. However, once Luke’s sex scheme is foiled and the mask slips from his face, the Lerner residence seamlessly transitions into the “Terrible Place” (Clover 30), holding Ashley in thanks mostly to the duct tape that binds her. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Clover states that “in the hands of the killer, at least, guns have no place in slasher films” (Clover 31). This in tandem with the slasher comparisons appears to fall apart given that Luke kills Garrett with the shotgun, but Garrett was most likely not intended as one of Luke’s victims. Luke’s other successful kills make use of household amenities — paint can, rope, riding lawn mower — and indicate at least some degree of premeditation, while Garrett’s death comes because of Luke’s abrupt, impulsive, and possessive rage. Garrett’s death is ultimately an afterthought and not otherwise indicative of his planned rampage. Clover further explains how “victims sometimes avail themselves of firearms, but [...] guns fail in a pinch” (31), which resonates with Ashley’s attempted usage of the pistol. After Ricky is killed, she attempts to fire up towards the ceiling, and it fails her due to being unloaded. The majority of the weapons and manners of killing used by Luke throughout the film hearken to the slasher’s pre-technological emotional terrain. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Perhaps the greatest contrast from the typical slasher that <em>Better Watch Out</em> delineates is the lack of female victims; as aforementioned, there are no scantily-clad teenagers killed. Ashley serves as a dual image of victim and of final girl. Her death is, for all intents and purposes, a death. Until it isn’t. The male victims of <em>Better Watch Out</em> follow the outline of a slasher more closely. Clover states how “the death of a male is nearly always swift” (35), which rings true for all three deaths. Ricky is seldom granted the opportunity to properly parse and comprehend his peril thanks firstly due to the blindfold and secondly due to the immediacy of his death; the paint bucket successfully swings into his head, and blood begins a cascading outpour, contrasting the vibrant yellow paint. Jeremy is given no time at all to comprehend his peril, as Luke wraps the noose around his neck and hangs him via the riding lawnmower before he can do anything more than feebly struggle against the rope. Garrett’s death is the most drawn out, and even he dies under twenty seconds after comprehending his peril, having outright stated that he is dying. Clover additionally details how “would-be rescuers are not infrequently blown away for their efforts, leaving the girl to fight her own fight” (43), which is precisely what happens to Garrett as he is blown across the room by the blast of the shotgun. He is quite literally killed for his efforts of trying to save Ashley, cemented by Luke screaming how “[he] told [Garrett] not to touch her” and asking “why did [he] make [him] do it”.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">What comes as a complete contrast to all three prior is Ashley’s discernible death. “Prolonged struggles, in which the victim has time to contemplate her imminent destruction, inevitably figure females” (Clover 47). Ashley not only contemplates her imminent destruction, but outright declares it, asking Luke for affirmation on him never actually planning to let her go. After being tormented for over half the film in a sick game of cat and mouse with Luke, with the violence against her being drawn out and glorified as she spends nearly an hour of the film being taunted and assaulted by him, she finally meets what we believe to be her end. Naturally, it is in both the most intimate manner of all as well the most sexually charged: she is stabbed by Luke, from behind, with a knife. The knife, of course, serves in horror theory as a stand in for the phallus; this is to say that his killing of Ashley is the penetration, the copulation, the rape of her that Luke sought all along. Much as Pauline of Perils fame was described, Ashley “is at her very most effective in a state of undress, borne down upon by a phallic murderer, even gurgling orgasmically as she dies” (Clover 42). After all, she has been stripped not only by her own hand, by presumably Luke’s and Garrett’s as well, given that the last time she is shown before the film’s big twist, she is wearing her blue tee shirt, and she is wearing a grey tank top afterwards. Even the orgasmically gurgling serves to resonate, wherein she first gives a sharp whine outwards before letting out said orgasmic gurgling; bearing in mind the ideation that Ashley’s stabbing is analogous to sex, consensual or otherwise, the reaction that the both of them have is likewise akin to orgasm. Ashley gasps and moans, while Luke’s breathing quickens immensely and his eyes roll backwards: they are climaxing because of his penetration. Moreover, the duct tape she uses to save her life would serve as a sort of anti-rape device, penetrating her wound just as Luke had her, inserted over herself; contrary to the penetration that would destroy her, this penetration serves as her savior.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Another component of not only the three actualized deaths of the film, but also Ashley’s apparent death, is how the victims are punished for their sexual transgressions. Men and women in horror are both killed for their sexual transgressions, albeit it in varying manners. For instance, when men are killed, the manner in which they die does not serve to remind them of said transgressions: there is no phallic imagery to be found in a paint can, nor hanging, nor even in the blast of a shotgun. The closest we get is Luke stabbing into Ricky’s cheek with the pencil that was hidden beneath the rug, but even that injury, while perhaps hearkening to Luke’s belief that Ricky has had sex with Ashley, is ultimately nonfatal, thereby not serving as a reminder of sexual transgression in death. Though it can be stated that all three men are punished for their sexual transgressions — Jeremy for starting a rumour that he had sex with ashley, Ricky for having such availability with Ashley even if they aren’t sexually active, and Garrett for kissing and touching her — there is no reminder of their crimes when they are slaughtered mercilessly by Luke. Ashley’s killing is, as stated, intimate and sexually charged, serving to remind her of the greatest transgression of all: not being sexually available to Luke. Such is why she gets Luke up close and personal to presumably end her life, while all three other kills happen from a distance. Additionally, while both Ashley’s death and Jeremy’s death both happen onscreen, Jeremy’s death is notably void of any gore; his reaction is similarly not intended to be erotic but emasculating as he helplessly chokes and struggles for air. We, in contrast, watch as the knife is shoved into Ashley, as she whimpers out, as Garrett’s blood is still splattered onto her bared skin.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">The final girl is “the image of the one who did not die” (Clover 35). The final image of Ashley is her giving Luke the middle finger whilst being wheeled into the stretcher; the exclamation that “This one’s still alive!” comes as cathartic release for the audience as a showcase of Ashley’s feminine triumph. She is “chased, cornered, wounded” (Clover 35), subjected agonisingly to Luke’s malicious schemes. While the men of the film are aware of their death only mere seconds before it occurs, just as Clover suggests, Ashley antithetically harbours an awareness of her impending peril; she “lives with the knowledge for long minutes” (Clover 35) and even goes on to act accordingly with it in mind. Furthermore, Clover states the final girl as “alone look[ing] death in the face” (, which Ashley does with her consistent and blatant rebellion against him. Despite Luke pointing what she believes to be a loaded gun at her, she refuses to bend to his whims, even going so far as to refuse to involve anyone else in his schemes when the anyone else in question is Jeremy, someone she has a comprehensively detailed dislike for. She also knocks into the alcohol bottle with the roofies in it, causing it to break and shatter on the floor when Luke drops it, and, similarly, she lures Luke in with false pretences of submission before quite literally kicking him in the balls, akin to what Garrett threatened Luke with earlier.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Though she does not look death in the face in the most literal sense, given her refusal to look at Luke before her quote-unquote death, that same action instead looks death in the face in a figurative sense; she refuses to submit to his order, accepting and even embracing that she will die rather than give him what he wants. Ultimately, the final girl “finds the strength [...] to stay the killer long enough to be rescued” (Clover 35), showcased in how Ashley plugs her wound with duct tape to stop her bleeding and thereby save herself such that she can be rescued. Final girls are also described as “show[ing] more courage and levelheadedness than their cringing male counterparts” (Clover 36): while Ashley showcases courage in all faces of adversity, Garrett is contrarily the spitting image of cowardice until only seconds before his death; Ricky is not only humiliated by urinating himself while bound in place, but also how he pathetically begs and pleads for his life; Jeremy is fuelled so much by his emotionally-driven desire to see Ashley and reconnect with her that he bends to Luke’s whims, even without good reason to do so.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">There are three primary characteristics of the final girl, as described by Clover: virginal, observant, and resourceful. These characteristics fit Ashley to a T, being some of her most palpable and defining characteristics. Ashley’s virginity is outright stated no less than twice, and she is not only not sexually active, but not sexually available, either; she rejects Luke, and it is all but confirmed that Ashley intended to break up with Ricky for her big move, as well, further separating herself from male attention. Ashley’s watchfulness is not something that can be understated, either. Her paying attention to the framed photos of the Lerner residence helps her to realise the scheme that Luke and Garrett blindly led her into by way of her calling out Garrett wearing Luke’s ski mask. Ashley is consistently attuned to her physical environment, always cognizant of her surroundings. Fascinatingly, such is a glaring dissimilarity to her behaviour in the beginning of the film, wherein she almost hits a cat on the road due to her distracted driving. To round out the triad of traits, Ashley’s resourcefulness is by far her most defining characteristic of all. She is resourceful in how she takes notice of a flashlight on the counter and uses it to attempt a flashing rescue signal out of the window. She is resourceful in how she notices a stray shard of glass from her broken bottle endeavour that she uses to successfully free herself from her duct tape constraints. She is resourceful in how she pits Garrett and Luke against one another by bringing up how Luke killed Garrett’s hamster. And, perhaps most triumphantly of all, she is resourceful in how she uses duct tape to stop the bleeding in her stab wound, turning Luke’s claim of “1001 uses for duct tape” against him.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Our closeness to Luke wanes as our closeness to Ashley waxes; more and more, while Luke plummets and descends into inhumane malice and vitriol, Ashley is instead continuously humanised. She possesses a strong moral compass, acting as a direct foil to Luke’s depravity, both in declarations of protection against the innocent and the vulnerable and in her direct protective actions. She immediately attempts to bargain with Luke to have Ricky released. She valiantly refuses to directly involve Jeremy in Luke’s scheme, even with a gun held to her, even when Jeremy has shown a consistent slew of poor behaviour throughout his short time and impact on the film. And, even after all of Garrett’s compliance with Luke’s schemes that directly harmed Ashley, she plainly states that Luke will not hurt Garrett because she will not allow it. Even though Garrett has been a nuisance at best and a willing participant in Ashley’s assault and debasement, she sacrificially takes the burden upon herself in swearing to protect him against Luke.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">The audience’s empathy capacity for Luke similarly wanes as his true self is revealed and he tears the mask away from his own face: he has lived a life of consistent privilege, with nothing to threaten him getting his way. A letter shown in the film states that the Lerners live in Winnetka, Illinois, which is one of the wealthiest places in the United States when ranked by household income. He has a room full of trophies, accomplishments, and other things to occupy his attention and his greed. There are no fewer than eight trophies displayed on the shelf in his room, coupled alongside a smattering of certificates for all his various proficiencies. Awarding academic excellence, science fair, chess championship, certificate of achievement; all a testament not only to the person he portrayed himself as, but also to his never-ending lust for praise, attention, and success. He has an extremely large television in his room with a gaming console, a guitar, multitudes of books and DVDs, board games upon board games upon board games, and he states at one point that he knows tae-kwon-do: Luke is extremely privileged in all that he does, and this has aided in the violent culmination of all his entitlement.</p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Ashley, incongruously, is depicted as disprivileged throughout the film’s span. She has been subjected to social ire thanks to the rumour Jeremy has spread. Nearly every man in the movie is predatory or otherwise creepy to her in some capacity. Luke’s father flirts with her and compliments her much more than necessary. The pizza deliveryman waits until Luke has disappeared deeper into the home to wish Ashley a pleasant night. Jeremy violates Ashley’s privacy by spreading the sex rumour about him. Garrett both goes along with Luke’s scheme, at least initially, for the prospect of getting some sexual action from Ashley, and kisses her on the cheek while she has been restrained with duct tape and Christmas lights. Luke is the crown prince of leveraging Ashley’s disprivilege against her. There is the looming threat of rape and sexual violence, especially with the introduction of roofies into the mix. There is the actualized sexual violence by way of his nonconsensual groping of her breast, while she is both pleading for him not to and while she is restrained and therefore unable to stop him and revoke her consent by way of physical refusal. There is the attempted kissing at the beginning of the film, where he clings onto her and continues his unwanted attempt even while she repeatedly says no, and there are the subsequent forehead kisses in the first kiss’s wake; one after he gropes her during truth or dare, and one after he stabs her. Both kisses she cannot fight off come, like gentle affection, after sexual violence, be it allegorical or blatant. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">More specifics of the final girl are described as being “intelligent, watchful, levelheaded; the first character to sense something amiss and the only one to deduce from the accumulating evidence the pattern and extent of the threat” (Clover 44). Ashley is immediately reactive to all of Luke’s and Garrett’s manufactured scheme, perhaps to an even greater extent than either of the boys anticipated. She arms herself with a knife and acts protectively over the boys; fascinatingly, the only time where Ashley wields the phallus is when the true killer is not apparent, and thus when she cannot adequately comprehend her peril. As it stands, Luke sought a screaming, vulnerable victim — the sort of victim that screamed for him to kill spiders and whom behaved neurotically at the sighting of even the most banal of horror movies — and instead served as the catalyst for Ashley’s phoenix-esque rebirth into the final girl. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Just as Luke, being the slasher killer, has his masculinity compromised by the onset of femininity by way of boyishness, Ashley, being the final girl, has her femininity compromised by being forcibly masculinized to survive the situation she has been imposed into. Ashley at the beginning of the film is nowhere near as boyish as the prototypical final girl would indicate; she is neither girl scout, nor bookworm, nor mechanic. What she does carry the torch with in terms of outward final girl imagery, however, is her name: Ashley, while not necessarily a male name for the Americentrist viewpoint that the film depicts (despite its majority Australian cast and setting), is often shortened to Ash by the characters surrounding her in <em>Better Watch Out</em>, which does bear a stronger male connotation and thereby masculinising Ashley more to that of her fellow final girls. But Ashley as prototypical hysterical victim is feminine. Her hair is styled, she sports white and blue clothing that boasts symbolism of innocence, of purity, of femininity, she screams in terror about a spider and grabs Luke’s hand during the horror movie as a physical sanctuary against her trepidation. Ashley as prototypical final girl, contrarily, has turned masculine. She becomes increasingly angrier and more physically dishevelled as the film goes on, with her hair becoming messier and with tears, messy makeup, and blood smeared all over her face. She, having been undressed by Luke and Garrett, no longer sports innocent blues and whites, but instead an androgynous grey; grey, which is viewed as too weak to be masculine but too menacing to be feminine” (Heller). She has turned masculine to survive the events of the film: she has become angry, being granted the same righteous and heavenly anger that Luke perceives himself as having. </p><br>
<p style="text-transform:lowercase;">Ashley’s triumph over Luke couples neatly with more of Clover’s description of The Body, stating “it is the male killer's tragedy that his incipient femininity is not reversed but completed (castration) and the final girl's victory that her incipient masculinity is not thwarted but realised (phallicisation)” (50). It is in this way that Luke’s feminisation and overarching boyishness is his undoing, while Ashley is empowered by her ascension to masculinity. In the final moments before Ashley’s supposed death, beginning with a kick in the balls that for all intents and purposes serves as being analogous to castration, Luke recounts the apparent root to his motherly issues, lamenting that he doesn’t know why his mother stopped holding him as she used to. Boldly, Ashley states that she knows why before completely shutting down. Unspeaking, eyes closed, absolutely no willingness to engage in any capacity. She weaponises stoicism, silence, and dominance like a man. This entirely sets Luke off as he begins begging and pleading for attention. Any attention: for her to open her eyes, for her to say something, for her to answer the question, for her to look at him, for her to tell him he’s fucked up, for her to tell him she’s disappointed, for her to say that she’s scared or that she wants to go home, for her to say something. He is feminised thanks to his emotional outburst in search of attention, and he attempts to reinforce her feminine by way of returning to calling her the more feminine Ashley, rather than the masculine Ash nickname he had otherwise opted towards for much of the film’s duration. Luke’s castration has been completely thanks to his emasculating feminine outburst, while Ashley’s phallicisation has been completed by way of her plugging up the vulvic of her stab wound, shedding her femininity and making the fullest descent into the final girl’s androgyny to survive.</p>

            <details>
            <summary>the monstrous feminine</summary>
            <p>in barbara creed's the monstrous feminine, she outlines several archetypes of female monsters prevalent in horor films: archaic mother, vampire, witch, woman as monstrous womb, woman as possessed body, the castrating mother, woman as beautiful but deadly killer, aged psychopath, woman as deadly femme castratrice. she explains how emphasis is mostly put upon woman as the victim of the monster, rather than woman as the monster. moreover, freud links man's fear of woman to a juvenile belief that the woman is castrated, moreover possessing the vagina that castrates.</p><br>
            <p>mythology that goes hand-in-hand with the idea of the castrating vagina is that of <i>vagina dentata</i>, and specifically how the women must be tamed by a hero figure before intercourse can safely sake place. luke attempts to tame ashley by acting as a hero figure and her savior so that intercourse can take place: curiously, though there is ample opportunity for penetration should it be what luke desires, he never engages in such an act with ashley.</p><br>
            <p>the monstrous feminine in better watch out is not one immediately obvious outright. creed explains that, "as with all other stereotypes of the feminine, from virgin to whore, she is defined in terms of her sexuality". moreover, "it is the male fear of castration which ultimately produces and delineates the monstrous". however, creed ultimately argues that "when woman is represented as monstrous it is almost always in relation to her mothering and reproductive functions". herein lies the centerpoint of my argument. deandra lerner depicts the archaic mother, whereas ashley depicts the castrating mother.</p><br>
            <p>abjection and the archaic maternal figure are embodied by deandra lerner, especially where it pertains to the absence of robert as a proper father. though he is not entirely absent when compared to that of carrie's father in carrie, robert lerner lacks the proper makings of a traditional father. robert has a lack of traditional paternal authority, and deandra takes issue with his effeminate hobbies, which helps to construct her as monstrous feminine. she is smothering to luke, beginning her tenure in the film by nagging him about bedtime and brushing his teeth, refusing to relinquish her hold on him. even luke's first brush in life with authority pertains to that of his mother's supremacy, constantly expressing fear throughout the film over banal things that would invoke her wrath.</p><br>
            <p>creed states that "the archaic mother is the parthenogenetic mother, the mother as primordial abyss, the point of origin and of end". while it perhaps goes without saying that deandra did not reproduce asexually using only her eggs, it stands to reason that she acts as the parthenogenetic mother in her own right, shirking the aid of her emasculated husband. with the archaic mother as the "sole origin of all life", deandra acts as a motivating axis for luke, from his womb noise machine to how all the killings in the movie were stemming from her as purpose. even the archaic mother existing as a "non-presence" nevertheless suit's deandra's role, as she is absent for the vast majority of the film, and luke's major gripe he shares with ashley is that his mother is no longer present in the way he desires. moreover, despite said "non-presence", she is simultaneously omnipresent, again with how luke scurries around the house in fear of her authority. her home, with immaculate presentation and strict rules that luke tirelessly abides by, come to represent the womb, an environment where she reigns supreme and all must conform to her standards. the lerner residence as deandra's womb is a space that is both nurturing and confining; a place of origin and supposed safety. in this sacred space, luke enacts his violent, destructive fantasies, highlighting the duality of creation and annihilation inherent in the archaic mother archetype.</p><br>
            <p>deandra showcases a particular relationship with the abject that pervades even through her absence in the majority of the film's duration. her authority in the home is coupled with profound emotional absence, creating a paradoxical figure that both enforces and deconstructs familial boundaries. she simultaneously embodies nurturing and neglect, stability and chaos. deandra attempts to maintain order in the house in a variety of ways, from refusing to allow anyone to step on the new carpets with their shoes on, to smothering luke with outward displays of maternal care. however, her control is superficial, masking her inability to provide genuine maternal care. her focus on apeparances and discipline reflects an effort to suppress the abject in her role, all the messy, emotional, and uncontrollable aspects of motherhood. furthermore, deandra's lack of genuine connection and understanding creates a void that destabilizes the familial structure; deandra's neglect becomes a source of horror, preceding luke's mental unravelling, as it represents a failure of the maternal role to nurture and protect.</p><br>
            <p>horror films often incorporate maternal relationship melodrama in the form of mother-son relationships, dancing across themes of repression, sacrifice, incestuous desire, and maternal incorporation. they are "usually represented in terms of repressed oedipal desire, fear of the castrating mother and pychosis". the castrating mother differs from the archaic mother in that her behavior is suffocating towards her offspring, a contrast from the so-called "non-presence" of the archaic mother. hitchcock's psycho is renowned for exploring "the figure of the mother as the punishing castrating parent". this mother is not feared because she lacks the phallus, but because she symbolizes a threat to the male's phallic power. the castrating mother wields significant authority and exerts a psychological influence that undermines traditional male power structures — in some ways, deandra and ashley behave as a dual image of the castrating mother.</p><br>
            <p>ashley's authority over luke is established early on in the film, someone responsible and mature; authority that places her in a quasi-maternal role, harboring an expectation to maintain order and ensure luke's safety. her authority is not only accepted but expected by luke and his parents, positioning her as a temporary maternal figure. moreover, ashley's instincts as a source of emasculation for luke are explored early on. consistently, she attempts to shield luke from harm, initially beliving the threats to be external. however, her protective nature and assertion of her authority undermine luke's burgeoning sense of independence and manhood, positioning her as a castrating figure. she does not allow herself to be saved, therefore luke's masculinity is at risk, denying his attempt to step into a more adult role. he is reinforced as subordinate and powerless.</p><br>
            <p>the duality of the monstrous feminine, simultaneously nurturing and destructive, is embodied by ashley not only in how she handles her interactions with luke, but in the actions she takes throughout the night to save her own life. even after luke's true plan is revealed, she attempts to protect him from himself, claiming that they can submit to the authorities now and no one will get in trouble (a bargaining chip of protection even after luke has assaulted her, molested her, and attempted to roofie her); this serves as a contrast to how she headbutts the bottle of alcohol out of luke's hands, causing it to shatter on the floor.</p><br>
            <p>all through the duration of the film, ashley's authority becomes a source of symbolic castration. her rejection of luke's advances and her attempts to control the situation mirror the dynamic between a mother and her child, where the mother's authority can be perceived as emasculating. moreover, luke's infatuation with ashley can be seen as an unconscious desire that mirrors the oedipal longing for the mother. this desire is complicated by ashley's authority and her resistance to luke's control; luke's violent actions reflect his attempt to overcome this perceived castration and reassert his dominance. ultimately, the relationship dynamics between luke, ashley, and deandra can be viewed through the lens of the oedipal triangle, where ashley acts as a stand-in for deandra, and luke's actions are driven by the underlying oedipal conflict.</p><br>
            <p>luke's relationship with deandra is marked by control and emotional neglect, wherein she imposes an authoritative presence while simultaneously carrying an physical and emotional unavailability that creates a void fuelling luke's oedipal longing and rivalry. ashley as a proxy mother intensifies this dynamic, as her authority and rejection mirror deandra's emasculating influence. moreover, much like norman bates in psycho, luke somewhat attempts to "become the mother in order to prevent his own castration – to castrate rather than be castrated". without a strong source of masculinity to build himself up upon — his father is emasculated and effeminate, and garrett is in love with him and follows his every order — luke turns to embodying the dominant force throughout the film: the castrating mother.</p><br>
            <p>from the outset, luke's desire to control not only his environment, but the people within it, is beyond evident: from the elaborate traps set up to aid in his plans, to the location tracker on his phone used to keep tabs on his parents. his elaborate seduction plan and later terrorism of ashley reflects a deep-seated need to assert poer and avoid the humiliation that comes hand-in-hand with rejection. when ashley rebuffs his advances, luke's reaction is not only one of a spurned suitor, but of someone whose very identity and sense of power are threatened. to reclaim his authority, luke transition into the role of the castrating mother. he orchestrates every detail of the evening, creating a controlled environment where he is the ultimate authority: a mirror image of what deandra enacts with herself, luke, and robert. in a general sense, his behavior mirrors the control a mother exerts over her child, but in luke's case, it is twisted into a pathological need to dominate and emasculate others to prevent his own castration.</p><br>
            <p>despite luke's efforts to dominate and control her, ashley's resilience and ultimate defiance highlight the limitations of his emulation of the castrating mother. her intelligence, cunning, and resourcefulness enable her to outsmark luke, signalling that true empowerment cannot be fully subdued by forced control. ashley's resistance is critical in underscoring the inherent strength that the castrating mother possesses. fascinatingly enough, despite all of the effort that luke puts in to purport an image of strength, it is he himself who acts as his greatest castrator. his back-to-back temper tantrums, first after killing garrett and second when ashley refuses to open her eyes, castrate him much more than ashley's rejection ever did. his temper tantrums server to reaffirm that he is not a man, that he is merely a child crying for the mother's attention.</p>

    <summary>eternal childhood and coming of age</summary>
    <p>childhood and adulthood are consistently at war in better watch out, betwixt the unstoppable object of coming of age and the immovable object of eternal childhood. this juxtaposition is explored in the contrast of luke's distorted maturation versus ashley's regression, offering a compelling exploration of the pressures and expectations of growing up. luke, on the cusp of adolescence, desperately strives to project an image of manhood through manipulation, control, and what he perceives to be masculine behavior, revealing a twisted interpretation of what it means to be a man. ashley, on the verge of entering college, retreats into the familiar role of babysitting, a position she has held since she was thirteen. her regression into this childhood responsibility symbolizes her anxiety and reluctance to embrace the uncertainties of adulthood; how she wishes not to grow up, how she wishes to hold onto where she is a little while longer, how her childhood as she knows it is being destroyed. to intricately weave these opposing trajectories forms a narrative that delves deep into the profound impact of societal expectations on the transition from childhood to adulthood.</p><br>
    <p>luke's desperate efforts to project an image of manhood are impelled by an intense need to be perceived as older and more capable and desirable than he truly is. unlike a typical teenager navigating the awkward stages of growing up, luke's coming of age is instead marked by a sinister manipulation of his surroundings and the people in his life. this is a facet of his persona revealed to have been present even before the night of the home invasion, seen when he reminds garrett of all of the incidents prior that luke formed schemes for in order to get both boys out unscathed. moreover, even his meticulous planning and execution of a home invasion scenario, operating under the belief that rescuing ashley from fabricated danger will position him as a hero and prove his maturity and worthiness of her affection, only serve to reinforce the profound depths of his immaturity and misguided understanding of adult relationships. this delusional strategy underscores how far removed luke is from genuine adulthood, conflating manipulation and deceit with bravery and heroism, highlighting his inability to navigate real emotional connections.</p><br>
    <p>his perverse attempt at valor underscores luke's warped view of adulthood, where control and dominance are equated with masculinity; a fascinating inversion of the dynamic taking place between his parents beneath the lerner family's roof. his actions are not merely the result of a misguided desire to grow up, but are symptomatic of deeper psychological issues. luke's need for control manifests in increasingly violent behaviors as his plan unravels, revealing his underlying insecurity and fragile ego. his calculated moves to subdue and terrorize ashley showcase a severely distorted understanding of power dynamics, wherein fear and subjugation are tools to assert his superiority, and tools to ultimately prove his manhood.</p><br>
    <p>furthermore, luke's behavior reflects the dangerous societal pressures placed on young boys to conform to toxic ideals of masculinity. the film critiques how these pressures can lead to destructive outcomes, as luke's perception of what it means to be a man is rooted in aggression and emotional detachment — a far cry from the mature figure he purported to be while attempting to court ashley. this skewed version of masculinity is not develped in isolation; it is influenced by a culture that often valorizes dominance, control, and emotional suppression as attributes of a 'real' man. luke's environment, media consumption, and even his parental figures all contribute to his warped understanding of adulthood.</p><br>
    <p>his lack of empathy and remorse as he escalates his violence against ashley and others shows a chilling transformation from innocence to a corrupted form of adulthood. this transformation is particularly jarring because it highlights how easily the innocence of childhood can be perverted under the wrong influences. luke's actions are a manifestation of his internalized belief that to be powerful and respected, one must instill fear and assert dominance, regardless of the moral or ethical consequences. luke is someone of immense talent — if the vast display of his awards and accomplishments at a remarkably young age is anything to go by — and yet his perception of what he must do in order to be properly regarded by those he yearns to possess has been dramatically altered by perverse influences.</p><br>
    <p>in a similar sense, luke as a character sheds light on the broader societal issue of how young boys are often discouraged from expressing vulnerability and emotional depth, leading them to seek validation through destructive behaviors. luke's journey from a seemingly ordinary adolescent to a calculating aggressor serves as a microcosm of this larger problem. his obsessed with proving his manhood through violent and manipulative means underscores the dangers of a societal framework that equates masculinity with emotional detachment and physical dominance. moreover, luke's interactions with his peers and the adults around him likely reinforce his belief that power and control are paramount. his actions throughout the film can be seen as a desperate attempt to fit into a mold that society has both implicitly and explicitly created for him. this desperation is evident in the extreme lengths he goes to fabricate a heroic scenario and the ruthless measures he employs to maintain his façade when things go awry; when he loses his cool after killing garrett, his emotions are stuffed back inside of himself, forced into a cold and emotionless serenity to claim apathy about the death of his best friend.</p><br>
    <p>luke's journey is also a commentary on the impact of media and cultural influences on young minds. his actions suggest an absorption of hyper-masculine stereotypes often glorified in movies, games, music, and other forms of entertainment. these media portrayals frequently depict men as powerful, emotionless figures who assert their dominance through violence and control. for a young, impressionable mind like luke's, these distorted representations of manhood become templates for behavior and identity. by emulating these distorted figures, luke attempts to bridge the gap between his peceived childishness and the adult image he desperately wishes to project. he models his actions on the exaggerated masculinity he sees in the media, believing that aggression, manipulation, and emotional detachment are the hallmarks of true maturity. his meticulous planning of the home invasion, his cold execution of violent acts (and subsequent glee), and his overall demeanor are all attempts to mimic the hyper-masculine heroes he idolizes.</p><br>
    <p>however, this emulation only serves to further alienate him from genuine human connections and a healthy maturation process. luke's understanding of relationships becomes transactional and manipulative, as seen in his interactions with ashley and garrett. he fails to grasp nuances of empathy, trust, and mutual respect that are essential for real, meaningful relationships. instead, he views interactions through a lens of power dynamics, where control and dominance are paramount. this is best showcased in how luke handles his friendship with garrett, viewing him as a means to an end rather than genuinely valuing the bond they share. he likes garrett because he can bend him to his will, finding gratification in the power dynamic.</p><br>
    <p>moreover, luke's reliance on media-influenced stereotypes highlights the lack of positive role models in his life. robert, while not necessarily absent, is hardly a guiding figure, especially in the shadow of deandra's overbearing nature, and that coupled with an apparent void of other influential figures leaves luke to fill the gaps with the problematic examples he finds in media. not to mention, his backwards trajectory into an inverse of what true masculinity should be is likely only amplified by his tumultuous relationship with deandra, loathing her verbal nagging and yet feeling empty without the physical touch and validation of his mother. this absence of real-world guidance exacerbates luke's descent into a distorted version of adulthood, as he has no counterbalance to the toxic ideals he absorbs.</p><br>
    <p>luke's bedroom is a direct reflection of his true age. scattered with video games, toys, books, and other juvenile forms of entertainment, his room is a tpyical adolescent space, devoid of the sophistication or order one might associate with adulthood. this chaotic environment underscores his lingering childhood interests and highlights the discrepancy between his physical surroundings and the mature image he tries to project. the height marker ticks on his door frame further accentutate his developmental stage, serving as a literal measurement of his growth and a metaphor for his psychological immaturity.</p><br>
    <p>his behavior throughout the film also betrays his attempts at appearing grown-up. his voice cracks at various moments, a natural occurrence for boys in puberty but a stark reminder of his actual age when juxtaposed with his violent and manipulative actions and dialogue. furthermore, luke's picky eating habits reveal his childlike preferences. due to his firstly asking for no mushrooms and then physically picking them off of his pizza, it is a trivial but telling detail that helps to accentuate his juvenile palate and further distances him from the adult persona he tries to adopt. this small act of food preference serves as a subtle yet powerful indicator of his true age and immaturity.</p><br>
    <p>despite luke's bravado and ruthless behavior, he is still very much under the thumb of parental authority. his anxiety about getting in trouble with his mother after the chaos he creates reveals his dependency and lack of true independence, traits characteristic of a child rather than an adult. in addition, the attachment he shows to his mother throughout the film — from yearning after ashley as a proxy of his mother to wistfully explaining how his mother doesn't hold him at night anymore — is dichotomous to the independent young man he otherwise purported to be.</p><br>
    <p>in stark contrast to luke's distorted attempt to project adulthood, ashley's arc represents a regression back into her childhood role of babysitting. despite being on the verge of entering college and embarking on the next phase of her life, ashely retreats to the familiarity and comfort of her past responsibilities. her decision to babysit luke one final time symbolizes her reluctance to let go of her childhood and step into the uncertainties of adult life. babysitting, a role she has held since she was thirteen, provides her with a sharp sense of control and competence. it is a familiar duty where she feels capable and in charge, contrasting heavily with the dark abyss that lies ahead in college.</p><br>
    <p>furthermore, a consistent throughline of luke's interest in the film is ashley's virginity. he is of the belief that she had lost her virginity to jeremy, despite ashley's insistence that such a story isn't true. she has not had sex with jeremy nor with ricky, and shows a general disinterest in sex throughout the film. sex is commonly regarded as a prominent theme in coming-of-age, often as a plot mainstay in media revolving around a character's coming-of-age, and yet ashley expresses no such desire. ashley's rejection of sexual engagement is a way of preserving her innocnece and avoiding the complexities associated with adult relationships — something aided by the playfulness in ricky's initial traipse into the film despite the disconcerting context. he playfully asks if she's hiding, and states that he'll find her, as though they are playing a juvenile game of hide and seek. moreover, luke states how ashley drinks with ricky all the time, which feels much more reminsicent of teenage lovebirds doing taboo activities rather than an adult relationship.</p><br>
    <p>even the role ashley plays as the would-be damsel in distress and later victim serve to reinforce the more puerile aspects of her demeanor and behavior. the archetype of the damsel in distress inherently emphasizes innocence and vulnerability, characteristics often associated with childhood. when ashley finds herself forced into this role, it highlights her need for protection and rescue, traits commonly seen in children rather than adults. this reinforces her reluctance to step into a fully autonomous adult role, instead swallowed in the apotheosis of dependence as she clings to luke in the closet and forces herself to be reminded that she is the adult here.</p><br>
    <p>when ashley transitions from the damsel in distress to the ultimate victim, she experiences a significant loss of control, emblematic of the vulnerability and helplessness often felt by children. unlike an adult who might be expected to fight back or find a way to escape, ashley's victimization underscores her inability to assert control over her circumstances, reinforcing her connection to childhood and its associated powerlessness. she is forced into a position where she cannot speak unless outright permitted, unable to voice her thoughts or protest against her captor — much like how a child could be punished for backtalk against their parents or authority figures — and she is effectively grounded, forced to stay inside the house. this restriction on her movement is akin to a child's punishment, not allowed to go outside or engage in activities as a consequence of their actions: the action ashley is facing consequences for is not relinquishing the sex to luke that he feels he deserves.</p><br>
    <p>initially, the lerner household represents a safe and controlled environment. it is a familiar setting where she feels secure and competent, much like the protective bubble that parents create for their children. this environment is characterized by its established routines and a sense of order, mirroring the structured and sheltered life of childhood. the house is furthermore a protective bubble, symbolic of security and predictability that ashley clings to. within its walls, she exercises control and authority as the babysitter, embodying the role she's known for five years. this bubble allows her to maintain a sense of stability and comfort, shielding her from the uncertainties and challenges of the outside world. however, as the events of the film unfold, the house transforms from a safe haven into a place of terror and confinement. luke's sinister and deplorable actions shatter the illusion of safety that the house once provided. the invasion of this one-safe space exposes ashley to the unpredictability and cruelty of the outside world. her victimization within the confines of the house forces her to confront these harsh realities head-on, stripping on the protective layer of childhood.</p><br>
    <p>luke's temper tantrums, which erupt after the night's events, reveal his true nature. despite elaborate schemes and attempts to project an adult persona, his behavior ultimately exposes him as a child. his inability to handle frustration and failure with maturity showcase his underlying immaturity and emotional instability, a stark reminder that, despite his violent actions and manipulative tactics, luke is still a child, struggling with the limitations and emotional volatility of youth. in contrast, ashley's journey throughout the night is one of forced maturation. initially clinging to the familiar comfort of her childhood role as a babysitter, ashley is thrust into a terrifying situation that strips away her sense of security and control. unlike luke, whose behavior regresses, ashley is compelled to grow and adapt rapidly to survive.</p><br>
    <p>throughout the night, ashley is confronted with harsh realities that shatter her innocence. she experiences fear, betrayal, and violence — elements that force her to abandon the protective bubble of her childhood. even being made to suffer sexual assault is a signifier of her forced coming of age, joining the statistic of 1 in 4 north american women sexually assaulted during their lifetime. this sudden exposure to adult challenges catalyzes the transitory period, pushing her to develop a newfound resilience and determination that is a far cry from the timid and unobservant girl the audience meets at the beginning of the film.</p><br>
    <p>everything that ashley endures necessitates a rapid development of resilience and emotional strength. she is forced to confront her fears and take decisive action to protect herself and others, a growth emblematic of transition from childhood to adulthood; reliance on others giving way to self-preservation and inner strength. unlike luke, who remains trapped in his childish mindset and oedipal dependency on a mother figure, ashley evolves into a more mature and capable person, having completed her graduation into adulthood in the span of only a single night.</p>
