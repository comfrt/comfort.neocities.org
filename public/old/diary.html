<h2>2023-08-16</h2>
<p>eek! it's my birthday today! i just wanted to pop my head in quick and say hi to everyone. i'm hoping to get my butt into
gear again in the very near future, perhaps with a typology page because i've had <em>such</em> an interest in it lately. i'm
going thrifting later today, maybe i'll make a thrift finds page! take care everyone! you are loved!</p>
<h2>2023-07-15</h2>
<p>wow! long time no see, guys! i think i got super burnt out after making my new layout, unfortunately. but i'm gonna try to
kick my butt into gear and get back to working on things around here, especially because it sparked my interest in web design
and development as a career choice!</p>
<p>for an update in me in particular, i'd say the most significant thing that happened to me
whilst i've been away from neocities is my interest in danganronpa came back! i've actually been a fan for a very long time,
as i read trigger happy havoc on the something awful forums before the official english translation. but i've been roleplaying
it a lot, and generally just thinking about it a lot. i've been playing danganronpa v3 with nick! his favorites are gonta,
himiko, and ryoma, while my favorites are miu, korekiyo, and kiibo. miu and korekiyo especially i have a lot of feelings about,
both with them as characters and as a ship, hehe. i think i may make a page about my mental health headcanons for the characters
as i do think about it quite a fair bit. korekiyo and miu, for instance, i definitely both headcanon as having autism, amongst
other things. i think it's nice to see traits of myself in fictional characters as that makes it easier to relate to them and 
empathize with them. <span class="alyssa">ðŸ˜ƒ</span> so yeah! danganronpa has completely had my heart lately, and there will
likely be pages to come to indulge my hyperfixation/possible special interest about it. particularly shrines for miu and mikan.
i have so many thoughts about them. i love them super bad.</p>
<p>i'm coming up on two years with nick, as well! though our official anniversary is in september, we've been acting as a couple
since july 2021, so mentally i almost consider around <em>now</em> to be my anniversary with him. but i'm so happy. i got him a
nice knife block for his birthday. . . it feels so good to get each other things. and he was so, so appreciative. my angel.</p>
<p>i also ended up getting a ps vita and modded it! which. . . may or may not have been spurred by my danganronpa hyperfixation,
since i can ply the vast majority of the games on a ps vita and all. teehee. totally worth it, though. i absolutely love my vita.
though between it, my 3ds, my wii, and my ps2. . . i'm kind of overwhelmed with games to play!</p>
<p>my final note to end this off is that i definitely want to code this better. perhaps i'll make sub-pages for each entry, or a
sort of month - to - month deal. it wasn't a big deal when my diary updates were so short, but gosh, if they all end up this
length. . . yeah, perhaps that's my first order of business. maybe i'll even do that today! anyways, i hope you're all well, and 
please feel free to message me via socials linked on my about page if you ever need anything. someone to talk to, coding help,
whatever it is, i'll try my very best. alright! gonna try and play some pokemon x today! bye!</p>
<h2>2023-03-16</h2>
<p>first update on the new layout! i thought i'd try out doing a bit longer of a diary update, even though i'm truthfully not much accustomed to longer form diary updates. i always try
writing in a diary, a physical one, but i always forget about it by the second day. alas! i've been working on the new layout here for a few days now, and i'm super proud of myself
as i did it almost entirely by scratch! i did reference sadgrl.online's layout generator, but that was more to ensure i had everything positioned properly.</p>
<p>so. . . what's up with me? well, i had a 7 hour shift at work yesterday, which thankfully went by super quickly. when my shifts are a bit longer like that, i'm always thankful
for when they're closing shifts, as my mandated closing duties eat up at least an hour of my shift. then another half hour for my lunch, and at that point my shift is more like 5 hours
of actual work! but as for today. . . hmm, well. . . i'm hoping to walk down to my local dollar store when i get the motivation to, buy myself some snacks and goodies. and my angel
of a boyfriend is going to get on today to play games with me, so i am very excited for that <span class="alyssa">ðŸ˜ƒ</span> otherwise, my agenda today is completing the layout
revamp enough so that i can actually implement it on neocities, and it can live somewhere else than a smattering of .html and .css files on my computer.</p>
<p>ah. . . and now i've returned from the dollar store! i got myself some treats, and now i've been helping out in a nintendo homebrew server. it makes me so so happy to be able
to help people with something i'm so passionate about and have so much love for.</p>
<h2>2022-12-20</h2>
long time no see! life's been rowdy. i've been obsessed with watching homebrewed 3ds tours to get ideas for games to put on mine. take care of yourselves.
<h2>2022-11-04</h2>
hoping to finally take some time to decompress and play around on my 3ds. been watching a lot of tama hero/tamashii hiroka lately... maybe i'll do a page about my childhood youtube favorites !
<h2>2022-05-31</h2>
