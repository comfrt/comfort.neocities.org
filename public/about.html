              <h2>themes</h2>
              <center><p>these are some of my favorite themes, often found as either subtext or text in the media i consume. please note that i don't think the exploration of certain
                themes is an inherent endorsement.
              </p></center>
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li><b>bodily autonomy and sovereignty:</b> reclaiming control over one’s body in environments where power, violence, or societal norms attempt to strip it away. this theme explores not just survival but the reclamation of choice, identity, and physical autonomy. characters confront forces that aim to reduce them to objects of control, pushing back against external dominance and asserting agency through acts of defiance, whether quiet or explosive.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>male violence and dominance:</b> exploring how patriarchal systems impose control—physically, emotionally, and psychologically—over female characters. power manifests in everything from personal relationships to societal structures, shaping how women navigate oppression. i’m drawn to how characters resist or sometimes even succumb to these dynamics, unpacking the personal cost of both survival and resistance, and how it impacts their identity.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>misogyny and internalized misogyny:</b> examining the pervasive societal oppression that women face, not just externally but within themselves. internalized misogyny complicates relationships, forcing characters to navigate harmful beliefs about gender that have shaped their identities. whether they have internalized being “not like other girls” or perpetuate the very ideals they wish to escape, i love analyzing how these tensions influence their connections with others and their sense of self.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>objectification:</b> the dehumanization of female characters, reducing them to objects—whether sexualized, commodified, or dominated by societal roles. through this lens, i enjoy breaking down how women’s bodies are treated as things to be controlled or owned, and how they fight to reclaim their personhood. the process of rejecting this reduction, and the creative ways in which they rebuild their identity, fascinates me.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>female sexuality and power:</b> the conflict between societal control of female sexuality and a character’s pursuit of autonomy. i explore how female sexuality is both weaponized against women and reclaimed as a source of empowerment. characters walk the line between subversion and suppression, transforming something often used to control them into a means of liberation. their navigation of this tension offers a powerful commentary on both oppression and freedom.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>transformation and weaponization of vulnerability:</b> characters turning their perceived weaknesses—often born from trauma or societal oppression—into strength. the journey from victimhood to empowerment is central here, as characters find ways to use the very things that were meant to break them as tools for survival and defiance. i’m fascinated by how these transformations occur, especially when vulnerability is no longer something to hide from but to wield as a weapon.</li><br>
              
              <li><b>resistance against oppression:</b> characters battling not just external systems of control—like societal expectations or physical domination—but also their own internalized struggles. resistance can take many forms, whether through violent rebellion, quiet endurance, or acts of subtle defiance. i love unraveling how characters carve out spaces of autonomy and survival, often in the smallest of actions, and the strength it takes to stand against ingrained forces of control.</li>
