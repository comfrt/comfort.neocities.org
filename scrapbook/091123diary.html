<p>very uneventful day today, but this really cute kitty came up to me while i was on a walk. she was so affectionate, but looked really clean and otherwise seemed
well taken care of so i think she was just out for the night! but oh my <i>gosh</i>, she was cuddling up to me and being such a sweetie - pie. i checked missing
pet listings on a local website and on facebook, and didn't see anything, so like i said, i'm just assuming she was out for the night. definitely wouldn't want
to take someone's cat on them. but kind of a highlight ... even if she started chasing me down after i tried to walk away with my mom and our dog because she
wanted me to give her affection that much.</p>
